## 1.1 BBB COMPLAINT

**Submit at:** https://www.bbb.org/file-a-complaint
**Business:** Investment Concepts Inc.
**Address:** 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865
**Phone:** (714) 283-5800

### Complaint Text:

I am a commercial tenant at Oregon Center in Oregon City, Oregon, managed by Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI).

**COMPLAINT SUMMARY:**

Since April 8, 2025—before I even took possession of the space—I have reported chronic roof leaks that have never been permanently resolved.

**KEY FACTS:**

- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (BEFORE I had keys)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration unresolved: 252+ days
- August 2025: ICI gave us 50% rent concession (written proof they acknowledge the defect)
- Despite concession: Roof STILL not fixed 4 months later
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ years—NOT receiving any concession
- December 2025: Told to "wait until spring"

**THE CONCESSION PROVES THE POINT:**

ICI gave us a rent discount. We did not ask for a discount—we asked for a roof that does not leak. The concession is written acknowledgment that ICI knows the roof is defective. But four months later, it is still not repaired.

Meanwhile, our neighbor with the identical problem for 2+ years is not receiving any concession. Same roof, same landlord, different treatment.

**ABOUT ICI:**

Investment Concepts Inc. manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona—1.8 million square feet. This appears to be a pattern of neglect, not an isolated incident.

**DOCUMENTATION:**

- 100+ emails spanning April–December 2025
- Photographs of every leak incident
- Video of active water intrusion
- ICI's written 50% rent concession letter
- Testimony from adjacent tenant confirming 2+ year pattern

**DESIRED RESOLUTION:**

1. Immediate written repair timeline
2. Completion of permanent roof repair

### Complaint Text:

I am a commercial tenant at Oregon Center, Oregon City, OR. My landlord is Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI), based at 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865.

**ABOUT ICI:**

Investment Concepts Inc. manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona—1.8 million square feet of property. What I am experiencing appears to be a pattern of conduct, not an isolated incident.

**COMPLAINT SUMMARY:**

Since April 8, 2025—before I even took possession—I have reported chronic roof leaks that remain unresolved after 8+ months. The landlord has engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices:

**1. FAILURE TO DISCLOSE KNOWN DEFECT:**
ICI rented me a commercial space knowing the roof leaked. The first leak was reported April 8, 2025, BEFORE I had keys. They acknowledged it, dispatched a roofer, failed to fix it, and handed me the keys anyway.

**2. FALSE STATEMENTS:**
On August 8, 2025, ICI Property Manager Hubert Kim stated in writing that I "declined" leak diverters. This was demonstrably false. I have security camera footage proving no such offer was declined.

**3. INCONSISTENT TENANT TREATMENT:**
In August 2025, ICI gave me a 50% rent concession—written acknowledgment they know the roof is defective. However, 4 months later, the roof is STILL not fixed. Meanwhile, my adjacent tenant with the SAME roof problem for 2+ years is NOT receiving any concession. Same roof, same problem, different treatment.

**4. PATTERN OF NEGLECT:**
My adjacent tenant confirms 2+ years of the same problem. I am now connecting with ICI tenants across all four states hearing similar stories.

**KEY FACTS:**

- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (BEFORE I had keys)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration unresolved: 252+ days
- August 2025: ICI gave 50% rent concession (written acknowledgment)
- Despite concession: Roof STILL not fixed 4 months later
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem 2+ years—NOT receiving any concession
- ICI's response: "Wait until spring"

**DESIRED RESOLUTION:**

1. Investigation of ICI's business practices across their portfolio
2. Permanent repair of the roof
3. Rent abatement for the period affected

**Submit at:** https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/pages/complaint.aspx
**Phone:** 503-378-4133

### Complaint Text:

**PROPERTY INFORMATION:**

- Property: Oregon Center (shopping plaza)
- Address: Oregon City, OR 97045
- Owner: Oregon Ctr. LLC, managed by Investment Concepts Inc.
- Owner Address: 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865
- Owner Phone: (714) 283-5800

**COMPLAINANT:**

- Name: Mike Alarcon
- Business: ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles
- Address: Oregon Center, Suite 127, Oregon City, OR 97045
- Phone: 503-389-5404
- Email: mike@orbsportscards.com

**COMPLAINT:**

I am reporting ongoing building code violations related to roof integrity and water intrusion at Oregon Center shopping plaza.

**NATURE OF VIOLATION:**

Multiple chronic roof leaks affecting at least 2 commercial tenant spaces with no permanent repair for extended periods (8+ months for my space, 2+ years for adjacent tenant).

**SPECIFIC ISSUES:**

1. Active water intrusion through the roof during rain events
2. 4 separate leak locations currently active in my suite alone
3. Water damage to interior ceiling tiles
4. Adjacent tenant reports same issues for over 2 years
5. Property owner refuses to make permanent repairs

**PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSE:**

ICI has stated the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season" despite having the entire dry season (April–October) to address the issue.

In August 2025, ICI gave us a 50% rent concession—written acknowledgment the roof is defective—but 4 months later still has not fixed it.

**Note:** ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across CA, NV, OR, and AZ. This appears to be a pattern.

- Phone: 503-389-5404
- Email: mike@orbsportscards.com

**COMPLAINT:**

I am filing a complaint against Investment Concepts Inc., a California-based property management company, regarding their management practices at a commercial property in Oregon.

**COMPANY SCOPE:**

ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona—1.8 million square feet. I am documenting what appears to be a pattern of tenant neglect across their portfolio.

**SPECIFIC ISSUES:**

1. **Known Defect Not Disclosed:** ICI rented me a space knowing the roof leaked. First leak reported April 8, 2025—BEFORE I had keys.

2. **False Statements:** Property manager made false written claims about declined repairs. I have security footage proving otherwise.

3. **Acknowledged But Not Fixed:** In August 2025, ICI gave me a 50% rent concession—written proof they know the roof is defective. Four months later, it is STILL not fixed.

4. **Inconsistent Treatment:** My adjacent tenant has had the same roof problem for 2+ years and is NOT receiving any rent concession. Same roof, different treatment.

5. **Unreasonable Delays:** ICI had April–October to repair. They didn't. Now they say "wait until spring."

**REQUEST:**

I am requesting the DRE investigate ICI's property management practices, particularly regarding maintenance obligations and consistent treatment of tenants across their portfolio.

## 2.1 EMAIL TO JEFFREY FRYE (CEO)

**To:** jeffreyf@icicorporate.com
**Subject:** Oregon Center Roof—252 Days Unresolved, Pattern Across Portfolio

Mr. Frye,

I am a commercial tenant at Oregon Center in Oregon City, Oregon. I am writing to you directly because eight months of communication through property management has not resolved a basic maintenance issue.

**THE FACTS:**

- April 8, 2025: We reported our first roof leak BEFORE we had keys
- Your team acknowledged the issue and dispatched a roofer
- The leak was not fixed before turnover
- August 2025: ICI provided a 50% rent concession acknowledging the ongoing issue
- We now have FOUR active leaks during peak retail season
- December 2025: We were told to "wait until spring"

**THE CONCESSION IS NOT THE POINT:**

Yes, ICI gave us a rent concession. That is not what we asked for. We asked for a roof that does not leak. The concession is acknowledgment that you know the problem exists—but the problem still exists.

We sell trading cards, cardboard products that water destroys instantly. A discount does not protect our inventory. A working roof does.

**THE BIGGER PICTURE:**

We have become aware that our situation is not isolated. We are now in contact with tenants across your portfolio in California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona who report similar patterns of deferred maintenance.

Our neighbor sharing the same roof has dealt with leaks for over two years—and they are NOT receiving any rent concession for the same issues.

We are documenting everything publicly: https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

**OUR ASK:**

1. Written repair timeline within 7 days
2. Permanent roof repair completed

We would prefer to resolve this directly. The alternative is continued public documentation of what appears to be a systemic pattern across your 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings—and evidence that affected tenants are being treated inconsistently.

## 2.2 EMAIL TO KIM WATSON (COO)

**To:** kimw@icicorporate.com
**Subject:** Oregon Center Maintenance Failure—Requesting Executive Intervention

Ms. Watson,

I am reaching out directly to request executive intervention on a maintenance issue that has been unresolved for 252 days despite extensive documentation and repeated reporting.

**TIMELINE:**

- April 8, 2025: First leak reported during buildout, before key turnover
- May 2025: Additional leaks appeared; contractor dismissed as "old stain"
- August 2025: Property manager made false written claim about declined repairs
- August 2025: ICI provided 50% rent concession acknowledging the defect
- December 2025: Now four active leaks, told to "wait until spring"

**THE CONCESSION PROVES THE POINT:**

ICI gave us a rent concession. We did not ask for a discount—we asked for a working roof. The concession is written acknowledgment that ICI knows the roof is defective. But four months later, the roof is still not fixed.

We operate a trading card shop. Our entire inventory is cardboard. A rent discount does not stop water from destroying our products. Only a working roof does.

**WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED:**

Our neighbor has dealt with the same roof issues for over two years. They are NOT receiving any rent concession. We are now connecting with tenants across ICI properties in California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona who describe similar experiences—deferred maintenance, unresolved complaints, and inconsistent treatment between tenants.

**Documentation:** https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

**REQUESTED RESOLUTION:**

1. Immediate written commitment to repair timeline
2. Completion of permanent roof repair

We have 100+ emails, photographs, video, and ICI's written acknowledgment of the defect. We are prepared to share this documentation—including the inconsistent treatment of tenants dealing with the same issues—with regulatory agencies, media, and other tenants.

We would strongly prefer a direct resolution.

## 2.3 EMAIL TO HUBERT KIM (Property Manager)

**To:** hubertk@icicorporate.com
**CC:** jeffreyf@icicorporate.com, kimw@icicorporate.com
**Subject:** Oregon Center Roof—Formal Escalation Notice

Mr. Kim,

This email serves as formal notice that we are escalating the ongoing roof leak issue at Oregon Center beyond property management.

**DOCUMENTED FACTS:**

- First leak reported April 8, 2025—before key turnover
- Issue acknowledged by ICI, roofer dispatched, not repaired before move-in
- August 2025: ICI provided 50% rent concession—written acknowledgment of defect
- Four active leaks as of December 2025
- 252 days without permanent resolution
- Written claim that we "declined" leak diverters—this was false
- Current response: "wait until spring"

**THE CONCESSION IS NOT A FIX:**

ICI gave us a rent concession in August. We did not ask for a discount. We asked for a roof that does not leak. The concession is proof that ICI knows the roof is defective—but four months later, it is still not repaired.

We sell cardboard products. A discount does not protect our inventory from water damage.

**WHAT HAS CHANGED:**

Our neighbor has had the same roof problems for over two years. They are NOT receiving any rent concession for the same issues. We are now in contact with tenants at other ICI properties across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona who report similar patterns—and similar inconsistent treatment.

**Documentation site:** https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

This site includes evidence that ICI acknowledges the defect through written concession but has not fixed it—and that tenants with identical issues are being treated differently.

**FINAL REQUEST:**

Provide a written repair timeline within 7 days. We require permanent resolution, not seasonal delays and not discounts.

This email is copied to Jeffrey Frye and Kim Watson. If we do not receive a substantive response, we will proceed with formal complaints and media outreach—including documentation of inconsistent tenant treatment.

## 3.1 KGW 8 (NBC Portland)

**To:** newstips@kgw.com
**Subject:** Small Business vs Corporate Landlord—Rent Discount Proves They Know, Still Won't Fix

Dear KGW News Team,

I'm reaching out about a local story with extensive documentation: a small trading card shop that reported a roof leak BEFORE they had the keys, received a rent concession proving the landlord acknowledges the problem, and STILL has four active leaks eight months later.

**THE QUICK PITCH:**

- Small family-run business vs California-based corporate landlord (1,400 miles away)
- First leak reported April 8, 2025—BEFORE taking possession
- August 2025: Landlord gave 50% rent concession—written proof they know roof is broken
- December 2025: Four months after concession, roof STILL not fixed
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ YEARS—NOT getting any concession
- Same roof, same landlord, different treatment

**THE SMOKING GUN:**

The rent concession is the key. ICI didn't fix the roof—they gave a discount. That proves they know the roof is defective. But a discount doesn't protect inventory from water damage. Only a working roof does.

**THE BIGGER PICTURE:**

Investment Concepts Inc. manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across CA, NV, OR, and AZ—1.8 million square feet. This appears to be a pattern, not an isolated incident.

**THE HUMAN ANGLE:**

A small family-run trading card shop trying to build community, hosting Magic: The Gathering tournaments, watching water threaten their dream because a corporate landlord would rather give discounts than fix the roof.

**WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR:**

A roof that doesn't leak. That's it.

Available for interview, store tour, and full document review including the rent concession letter.

**To:** rep.courtneyneron@oregonlegislature.gov
**Subject:** Constituent Request—Commercial Tenant Rights Issue

Dear Representative Neron,

I am a small business owner in your district seeking assistance with a commercial landlord issue that highlights gaps in tenant protections.

**THE SITUATION:**

My business, ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles, has dealt with unresolved roof leaks for 8+ months. Our out-of-state corporate landlord (Investment Concepts Inc., Orange County, CA) has:

- Known about the leak since BEFORE we had keys
- Given us a 50% rent concession (acknowledging the defect)
- STILL not fixed the roof four months later
- Told us to "wait until spring"

Meanwhile, our neighbor with the same problem for 2+ years is NOT receiving any rent concession.

**THE BIGGER ISSUE:**

ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across four states. Small commercial tenants have few protections when large out-of-state landlords defer maintenance.

**MY REQUEST:**

I would appreciate any guidance on:
1. Resources available to commercial tenants in Oregon
2. Whether this situation warrants legislative attention
3. Any constituent services that might help

## 7.1 LINKEDIN POST

I need to share something difficult.

I'm part of a small team running a trading card shop in Oregon City. We sell Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, sports cards—cardboard products that water destroys instantly.

We reported our first roof leak on April 8, 2025.

**Before we even had the keys.**

The landlord acknowledged it. The roofer was dispatched. It wasn't fixed. They handed us the keys anyway.

Eight months later, we have four active leaks during our peak retail season.

**Here's what makes this worse:**

In August, our landlord—Investment Concepts Inc.—gave us a 50% rent concession. That's written proof they know the roof is broken.

But a discount isn't what we asked for. We asked for a roof that doesn't leak.

Four months after that concession? The roof is still broken.

Meanwhile, our neighbor—same roof, same problem for 2+ YEARS—isn't getting any concession at all.

**The bigger picture:**

ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona. We're connecting with tenants across their portfolio. The stories are similar.

We're not asking for anything extraordinary. We're asking for a roof that doesn't leak.

It's now December. We have four active leaks.

**Tweet 2:**
We're @ORBSportsCards, a small trading card shop in Oregon City.

We sell Magic, Pokémon, sports cards—cardboard that water destroys instantly.

When we signed our lease, we expected basic maintenance.

We expected a roof that works.

**Tweet 3:**
In August, our landlord gave us a 50% rent concession.

That's WRITTEN PROOF they know the roof is broken.

But a discount isn't what we asked for. We asked for a FIX.

Four months later? Still leaking.

**Tweet 4:**
Our neighbor—same roof—has had this problem for TWO YEARS.

They're NOT getting any rent concession.

Same landlord. Same roof. Different treatment.

## 7.3 GOOGLE REVIEW (For ICI)

⭐ (1 star)

**Title:** They Gave Us a Discount Instead of Fixing the Roof

I'm a commercial tenant at an ICI property in Oregon. We reported our first roof leak in April 2025—before we even had the keys. The landlord knew and handed us the keys anyway.

In August, they gave us a 50% rent concession. That's written proof they know the roof is broken.

But a discount isn't what we asked for. We asked for a roof that doesn't leak.

Four months after that concession? Four active leaks. Their solution? "Wait until spring."

Meanwhile, our neighbor—same roof, same problem for 2+ YEARS—isn't getting any concession at all.

ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across 4 states. This appears to be a pattern.

# THE GOAL

**Make ignoring you more expensive than fixing the roof.**

You have everything documented. You have the smoking gun (the rent concession). You have the pattern (neighbor's 2+ years). You have the scale (29 centers, 63 apartments, 4 states).

Now execute the plan.

Good luck. 🎯
