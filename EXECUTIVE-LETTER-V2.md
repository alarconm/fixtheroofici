**RE:** Oregon City Shopping Center - Systemic Roof Failure, Deferred Maintenance Crisis, and Questions About Financial Oversight

---

## We Know Everything.

We are commercial tenants at Oregon City Shopping Center. We have spent considerable time researching Investment Concepts Inc., and we want to be direct: **we know exactly what is happening at your company.**

We know:

- That founder **George Chami passed away on January 11, 2025**, after running ICI for 56 years
- That there appears to be **no public succession plan**
- That **Jeffrey Frye now serves as both CEO and CFO**—a dual role that eliminates independent financial oversight
- That **Michele Saadeh, a Beverly Hills real estate attorney**, replaced Mr. Frye as registered agent on May 2, 2025
- That **George Chami Jr. is the designated officer** on ICI's California real estate license
- That ICI just paid **$3.75 million to settle Johnson v. Investment Concepts, Inc.**—a class action brought by nearly 9,000 tenants for fraudulent security deposit practices
- That ICI faces **Perez v. Investment Concepts, Inc.**—a pending wage theft class action from your own employees
- That ICI has a **D- rating from the Better Business Bureau** after failing to respond to 75% of complaints
- That employees describe ICI as a **"shady corporate environment"** where **"the company will do whatever it takes to not pay you"**
- That **Oregon City Shopping Center is in special servicing** with K-Star Asset Management, a subsidiary of KKR
- That nearby **Clackamas Town Center also defaulted on $191 million** in debt—part of a regional retail distress pattern

**We are not going away quietly.**

## The Property is Failing

Let us be absolutely clear about the condition of Oregon City Shopping Center:

**EVERY SINGLE RENTED SPACE ON THE PROPERTY HAS CONFIRMED ROOF LEAKS.**

This is not an isolated issue. This is systemic roof failure affecting:
- Our space (8+ months of documented complaints)
- **Coastal Farm & Ranch (so severe it floods their BASEMENT)** — water is penetrating through the entire building structure
- Multiple other tenants throughout the center

A roof leak that floods a basement is not a minor maintenance issue. That is catastrophic structural water intrusion. That is the kind of damage that gets worse every single day it goes unaddressed. That is the kind of condition a loan servicer would want to know about.

Your response to date: **Offer a 50% rent concession instead of fixing the roof.**

This tells us everything we need to know about ICI's financial position.

## A Pattern of Predatory Neglect

Your strategy is clear: **exhaust tenants until they give up.**

We have spoken with other tenants at this property. We know what happens when small business owners complain about roof leaks:

1. First, ICI ignores them
2. Then, ICI sends someone to "look at it"
3. Then, nothing happens
4. Months pass
5. Tenants eventually:
   - Give up and live with the damage
   - Pay out of their own pocket for repairs ICI should make
   - Create workarounds that don't fix the underlying problem
   - Exhaust themselves trying to get help and stop asking

**This works especially well against vulnerable tenants.**

We know about the small business owners at this property—including restaurant operators for whom English is not their first language—who have been subjected to the same neglect. They face barriers that ICI exploits:

- Difficulty navigating the legal and complaint process in English
- Focus on running their business with no time to fight their landlord
- Limited resources to hire attorneys or advocates
- Fear of retaliation from their landlord

**This is not neglect. This is a deliberate strategy.** A company that:
- Ignores complaints for 8+ months
- Fails to respond to 75% of BBB complaints
- Offers "concessions" instead of repairs
- Has a documented pattern across multiple tenants

...is counting on tenants giving up.

**Let us be direct about what this looks like:** When a landlord systematically ignores maintenance requests from tenants who face language barriers—tenants who struggle to navigate the complaint process in English, who lack resources to hire attorneys, who fear retaliation—that is not just bad business.

**That is predatory behavior.** Targeting those least able to fight back while collecting their rent.

This pattern may violate Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act. We are documenting everything.

**We are not those tenants.** And we are organizing the ones who are.

## This Goes Far Deeper Than Negligence

When we first started dealing with the roof leaks, we assumed this was simple negligence—a landlord slow to make repairs.

**We no longer believe that.**

The pattern we've uncovered—the 50% rent concession instead of repairs, the property in special servicing, the governance issues, the $3.75 million fraud settlement, the refusal to respond to complaints—tells a different story.

**There is no way ICI is meeting its obligations—to tenants OR to the loan servicer.**

Think about what we're describing:
- **Every tenant space has roof leaks**
- **Coastal Farm & Ranch has basement flooding** from water penetrating the entire structure
- **ICI's response is rent concessions, not repairs**
- **This has been going on for YEARS** for some tenants

A company meeting its deferred maintenance obligations doesn't have systemic roof failure across an entire 210,000 square foot property. A company meeting its loan covenants doesn't respond to catastrophic water intrusion by offering discounts instead of repairs.

**ICI is failing its tenants. ICI is failing its lenders. And ICI appears to be hoping no one connects the dots.**

K-Star Asset Management should know the true condition of their collateral. And if they don't, they're about to find out.

## Questions About Financial Oversight

The combination of facts we've uncovered raises serious questions:

### 1. Deferred Maintenance
- Is ICI properly funding deferred maintenance reserves as required by loan covenants?
- When was the last capital expenditure on this property's roof?
- Are the property's actual maintenance needs being accurately reported to lenders and the special servicer?

### 2. Financial Oversight
- With Mr. Frye serving as both CEO and CFO, who provides independent verification of financial statements?
- Are deferred maintenance liabilities being properly disclosed?
- Is the company meeting its loan covenant requirements?

### 3. Special Servicer Awareness
- Does K-Star Asset Management know that **every tenant space has roof leaks**?
- Does K-Star know that **Coastal Farm & Ranch has basement flooding**?
- Does K-Star know that ICI's response has been to offer rent concessions rather than make repairs?

**We intend to ensure they find out.**

## What We Want

1. **Immediate, permanent repair of the roof** at Oregon City Shopping Center
2. **Written timeline** for completion of repairs
3. **Rent abatement** for the full period of uninhabitable conditions (not a "concession"—an abatement reflecting your failure to provide a habitable premises)
4. **Confirmation** that deferred maintenance obligations are being met

---

## What Happens Next

If we do not receive a substantive response within **14 days**, we will:

1. **Notify K-Star Asset Management** of the property's true condition and your failure to maintain it
2. **File formal complaints** with Oregon regulatory agencies
3. **Contact the attorneys at Hogue + Belong and Ferraro Vega**—both of whom have successfully litigated against ICI
4. **Engage local and regional media** with the story of a distressed landlord collecting rent on a failing property while offering concessions instead of repairs
5. **Organize fellow tenants** for collective action
6. **Pursue all available legal remedies** for breach of lease, constructive eviction, and related claims

## A Message to ICI Employees

We understand that ICI employees may have information about the company's financial practices, maintenance decisions, or internal operations that is relevant to this situation.

**If you have information you believe should be shared, we invite you to reach out confidentially.**

You can contact us at: **fixtheroofici@proton.me**

All communications will be kept strictly confidential. We are particularly interested in information about:
- Deferred maintenance practices and funding
- Financial reporting and oversight
- Property condition reporting to lenders
- Internal discussions about Oregon City Shopping Center
- Any concerns you may have about company practices

We note that ICI employees have already publicly described the company as a "shady corporate environment" where "the company will do whatever it takes to not pay you." If you have more to share, we're listening.

**Whistleblower protections exist under both Oregon and California law.**

---

## Conclusion

We are well-resourced, well-informed tenants who have done our homework. We know about the founder's death, the lawsuits, the BBB complaints, the employee reviews, the special servicing, and the governance issues.

We know you're in a difficult position. The question is whether you'll do the right thing—fix the roof—or force us to escalate.

The choice is yours. You have 14 days.
