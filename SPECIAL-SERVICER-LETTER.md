Dear Ms. Johnson,

I am a commercial tenant at Oregon City Shopping Center, a property managed by Investment Concepts Inc. that I understand is currently in special servicing with K-Star Asset Management.

I am writing to alert you to **critical information about the physical condition of this asset** that may be relevant to K-Star's management of the loan.

## Property Condition Summary

**EVERY SINGLE RENTED SPACE at Oregon City Shopping Center has confirmed roof leaks.**

This is not an isolated maintenance issue. This is systemic roof failure across a 210,000 square foot property, including:

| Tenant | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| Coastal Farm & Ranch | **BASEMENT FLOODING** — water penetrating entire building structure |
| ORB Trading Cards | Active roof leaks for 8+ months, 4 current leak points |
| Thai restaurant | Same roof leaks for **2+ YEARS** |
| Multiple other tenants | Confirmed leaks throughout property |

**The Coastal Farm & Ranch situation is particularly alarming.** When roof leaks cause basement flooding, water is penetrating through the entire building structure. This is not deferred maintenance—this is catastrophic structural water intrusion that causes compounding damage every day it goes unaddressed.

The property was built in 1971 and renovated in 1999. Based on conditions across the property, the roof appears to require full replacement—a capital expenditure ICI appears unable or unwilling to fund.

---

## Landlord Response

Despite 8+ months of documented complaints, Investment Concepts Inc. has:

- **NOT repaired the roof**
- **Offered a 50% rent concession** in lieu of repairs
- **Failed to provide any timeline** for permanent repairs

This response tells us everything we need to know: **ICI either cannot or will not fund the necessary capital expenditure to protect your collateral.**

A company meeting its deferred maintenance obligations does not have systemic roof failure across an entire property. A company meeting its loan covenants does not respond to basement flooding with rent discounts.

**ICI is failing its tenants. We believe ICI is also failing its obligations to you.**

---

## Questions for K-Star's Consideration

As the special servicer responsible for maximizing recovery on this loan, you may want to investigate:

1. **Has ICI accurately reported the property's condition** in borrower communications?
2. **Are deferred maintenance reserves being properly funded** per loan covenants?
3. **What is the current state of the roof** and estimated replacement cost?
4. **Is the 50% rent concession being reported** as reduced income, or is the property's NOI being misrepresented?
5. **Are other ICI properties in your portfolio experiencing similar issues?**

## Background on Investment Concepts Inc.

Our research has revealed the following about the property owner:

- **Founder George Chami died January 11, 2025** (company was founder-led for 56 years)
- **No apparent succession plan** publicly disclosed
- **Jeffrey Frye serves as both CEO and CFO** (no independent financial oversight)
- **$3.75 million settlement** paid in October 2024 (Johnson v. ICI - tenant fraud class action)
- **Pending wage theft lawsuit** (Perez v. ICI - employment class action)
- **D- BBB rating** with 75% of complaints unanswered
- **Employee reviews** describe "shady corporate environment"

---

## Our Request

We are not asking K-Star to intervene in our landlord-tenant dispute. However, we believe you should be aware of:

1. The **true physical condition** of this asset
2. The **apparent failure to maintain** the property
3. The **rent concessions being offered** in lieu of repairs
4. The **questions this raises** about ICI's financial reporting

If the borrower is misrepresenting property conditions or failing to meet maintenance covenants, that is information relevant to K-Star's role as special servicer.

Sincerely,

# NOTES FOR USER:

## Why This Letter Matters:
- Special servicers are legally obligated to protect lender interests
- If ICI is misrepresenting property condition, that's a loan covenant issue
- K-Star has leverage over ICI that you don't have
- K-Star may not know how bad the property actually is

## Timing Options:
1. **Send simultaneously** with executive letter (maximum pressure)
2. **Send after 14-day deadline** if ICI doesn't respond (escalation)
3. **Send first** to K-Star and let them pressure ICI (indirect approach)

## What K-Star Might Do:
- Require ICI to make repairs as condition of loan workout
- Send their own inspector to assess property
- Accelerate foreclosure if ICI is violating covenants
- Nothing (but at least they'll know)

## Strengthening This Letter:
- Attach photos of roof damage/leaks
- Include copies of correspondence with ICI
- Get statements from other tenants (Coastal Farm & Ranch)
- Document the basement flooding specifically
