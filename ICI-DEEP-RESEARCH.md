# SECTION 3: CURRENT LEADERSHIP (Post-Founder Death)

## C-Suite Structure

| Role | Person | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **CEO + CFO** | Jeffrey Frye | **SAME PERSON - MAJOR RED FLAG** |
| President | Sam Benz | Former "Co-President" |
| President | George Mobayed | Former "Co-President" with Chami |
| Corporate Controller | Linda Keller | |
| Director, Commercial Leasing | Kim Watson | **NOT COO** despite earlier docs |
| VP of Acquisitions | George Chami (Jr.?) | USC '97-99, likely founder's son |
| Regional Director | Lisa Anderson | |
| Maintenance Supervisor | Erik McGinnis | |

## Jeffrey Frye - Deep Dive
- **Credentials:** CPA, MBA, Real Estate Broker
- **Education:** UC Irvine - Paul Merage School of Business (MBA 2014-2017)
- **Location:** Newport Beach, CA
- **CA Broker License:** 01985110
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfrye1/

### Career Timeline at ICI:
- **March 2023:** Joined as CFO
- **April 2024:** Promoted to COO/CFO
- **Post-January 2025:** Became CEO/CFO after Chami died

### Previous Experience:
- Principal, Jeffrey A. Frye CPA (May 2014 - Oct 2022)
- COO/CFO, Offices of James Andrew Cotter (April 2020 - April 2022)
- Consultant, CGI Cohen Goldstein Investment Strategies (April 2019 - Nov 2019)
- VP of Accounting, CGI Cohen Goldstein (April 2018 - April 2019)
- Controller/CFO, Cotter and Sons Inc. (Nov 2012 - May 2014)

### RED FLAGS:
- Only at ICI ~22 months before founder died
- Now holds DUAL CEO/CFO role - eliminates financial oversight
- This is his FIRST CEO position ever
- No one auditing the books when CEO = CFO

## Governance Concerns
Per Harvard Law Forum on Corporate Governance:
- Same person as CEO/CFO "essentially monitors themselves"
- "Can lead to abuse of power and position"
- CFO traditionally serves as financial check on management
- Combining roles eliminates that oversight function

## Lawsuit #2: Perez v. Investment Concepts, Inc.
### EMPLOYMENT CLASS ACTION (PENDING)

- **Case:** Perez v. Investment Concepts, Inc.
- **Court:** San Diego County Superior Court
- **Case Number:** 37-2023-00005209-CU-OE-CTL
- **Filed:** 2023
- **Status:** PENDING
- **Type:** Employment/Wage & Hour class action + PAGA claims

### Class Definition (Per Ferraro Vega):
"All individuals currently or formerly employed by Investment Concepts, Inc. in the State of California as hourly non-exempt employees at any time during the relevant statutory period listed in the complaint (e.g., four years for class actions and one year for PAGA actions) through the time of trial."

### What This Means:
- **Class action** = employees suing together for damages
- **PAGA** = Private Attorneys General Act - allows employees to sue for civil penalties on behalf of themselves AND the State of California
- PAGA penalties can be significant (up to $100/employee/pay period for initial violations, $200 for subsequent)

### Typical Allegations in PAGA/Wage Cases (Based on CA Labor Code):
*Note: Specific allegations for this case not publicly detailed*
- Unpaid overtime (failure to pay 1.5x for hours over 8/day or 40/week)
- Meal period violations (no 30-min uninterrupted breaks for 5+ hour shifts)
- Rest break violations (no 10-min paid breaks per 4 hours)
- Off-the-clock work
- Inaccurate wage statements
- Waiting time penalties (failure to pay all wages at termination)
- Expense reimbursement failures

### Corroborating Evidence - Glassdoor Reviews:
Employee reviews mention:
> "The company will do whatever it takes to not pay you. Takes forever to get commissions."
> "Underpaid employees"
> "Properties are short staffed"

These align with the type of wage theft claims typically seen in PAGA cases.

- Maximize recovery for lenders
- Modify loan terms OR
- Initiate foreclosure proceedings

- https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Angela-Johnson/10590881235

## What This Means for Tenants (Per Blackacre Advisors):
- Landlord may not have access to capital for repairs
- Special servicer focused on loan recovery, NOT tenant relationships
- Property could be foreclosed
- Less likely to make necessary property investments
- Tenant operations could be "in jeopardy"

## DSCR Theory
**DSCR = Net Operating Income / Debt Service**

If ICI is trying to maintain minimum DSCR to avoid further default:
- **Cutting maintenance expenses** to preserve NOI
- **Not responding to complaints** (saves time/money)
- **Giving rent concessions instead of repairs** (keeps rent flowing vs. losing tenants)
- **Short-staffing properties** (per Glassdoor reviews)
- **Not paying vendors/contractors** (per BBB complaints)

The 50% rent concession makes sense:
- Better to collect 50% than lose 100% if tenant leaves
- New tenant would demand repairs before signing
- Repairs = capital expense = kills NOI = DSCR drops = deeper default

## INFERENCES (Interpretations - May Be Wrong):

| Inference | Reasoning | Alternative Explanations |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| "Jeffrey Frye being sidelined" | Lost registered agent role | Could be routine - many companies use attorneys as agents for liability protection |
| "Family taking control from management" | Attorney brought in, Chami Jr is designated officer | Could be normal estate transition, standard practice after founder death |
| "Company preparing for sale" | Real estate attorney as agent, distressed properties | Could just be estate planning, no sale planned |
| "DSCR manipulation" | Not fixing roof, rent concessions, special servicing | Could be simple cash flow problems, not deliberate manipulation |
| "Michele Saadeh related to Julian Saadeh" | Same surname | Could be coincidence, common surname |

## WHAT WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN:
1. Founder died 11 months ago
2. Company changed registered agent from CEO to outside attorney 4 months after death
3. Company has $3.75M fraud settlement, pending wage theft lawsuit, D- BBB rating
4. At least one property is in special servicing
5. CEO is also CFO (dual role)
6. Founder's son is a designated officer on the company license

## WHAT WE DON'T KNOW:
1. Whether Jeffrey Frye is actually being pushed out or just had routine agent change
2. Who inherited ownership of the company
3. Whether estate is in probate
4. Full details of the special servicing situation
5. Whether other properties are also in distress
6. The actual relationship between Michele and Julian Saadeh

## 🚨 RED FLAG: Massive Job Count Discrepancy

### The Problem

**ICI claimed 253 jobs to justify $2.3 million PPP loan.**

But other sources consistently report far fewer employees:

| Source | Employee Count |
|--------|----------------|
| ZoomInfo | 21-49 employees |
| Other business databases | 20+ employees |
| ICI's own website | Does not disclose |
| Glassdoor reviews | "Properties are short staffed" |

### The Math Doesn't Add Up

**If ICI has 253 employees:**
- Average annual salary: $2.3M × 12 months ÷ 2.5 (PPP formula) = ~$11M annual payroll
- Per employee: ~$43,500/year average
- This is plausible IF they actually had 253 employees

**If ICI has ~35 employees (mid-range of reported):**
- They would have qualified for: ~$350,000 in PPP
- They received: $2,322,332.50
- **Potential over-claim: ~$2 million**

### Possible Explanations

1. **They counted property-level staff** - Maintenance workers, property managers at all 63 apartment buildings and 29 shopping centers
2. **They included contractor/1099 workers** - Not typically eligible for PPP
3. **They inflated the number** - Would be PPP fraud
4. **The 21-49 figure is wrong** - Possible but multiple sources agree

### PPP Fraud Context

The SBA Inspector General has investigated thousands of PPP fraud cases. Common fraud includes:
- Inflating employee counts
- Claiming non-existent businesses
- Using funds for non-payroll expenses
- Multiple applications for same business

**Note:** We are not accusing ICI of fraud. We are noting a significant discrepancy that warrants questions.

---

## What This Means for Your Case

### The Hypocrisy Angle

ICI took **$2.3 million in taxpayer money** to "protect paychecks" during COVID.

**Meanwhile:**
- Perez v. ICI alleges **wage theft** against employees
- Glassdoor reviews say company "will do whatever it takes to not pay you"
- Properties are "short staffed" per employee reviews
- Commissions "take forever" to get paid

**They took taxpayer money meant for workers while allegedly stealing from those same workers.**

### The Financial Picture

- **PPP Loan (forgiven):** +$2,348,355
- **Johnson settlement:** -$3,750,000
- **Perez lawsuit:** Pending (unknown exposure)
- **Net:** Still down ~$1.4M+ before legal fees

Even with the PPP bailout, they're in financial distress.

### Questions to Ask

1. How did ICI calculate 253 employees for their PPP application?
2. Were all 253 employees still employed after the covered period?
3. Did the $2.3M go entirely to payroll as certified?
4. How does this reconcile with the wage theft allegations?

# SECTION 16: THE FULL DISTRESS PICTURE

---

| **1969** | George Chami founds ICI | Company runs smoothly for 55 years under founder |
| **May 4, 2020** | **$2.3M PPP loan approved** | Claimed 253 jobs; Bank of America lender |
| **June 25, 2021** | **PPP loan 100% forgiven** | $2,348,355.35 taxpayer money kept |

---

## THE 11 RED FLAGS

### 1. FOUNDER DEAD, NO SUCCESSION PLAN
- George Chami (founder/owner) died January 11, 2025
- Ran company for 56 years
- Obituary mentions NO succession plan
- Company now in apparent leadership limbo

### 2. CEO = CFO (SAME PERSON)
- Jeffrey Frye holds BOTH CEO and CFO titles
- No independent financial oversight
- Per corporate governance experts: "essentially monitors themselves"
- This is his FIRST CEO role ever
- Only joined company ~2.5 years ago

### 3. $3.75 MILLION FRAUD SETTLEMENT
- Johnson v. Investment Concepts, Inc.
- Settled October 2024
- ~9,000 tenants defrauded through:
  - Falsified security deposit deductions
  - Charging for normal wear & tear (illegal)
  - Excessive late fees
- Pattern of document manipulation

### 4. PENDING WAGE THEFT LAWSUIT
- Perez v. Investment Concepts, Inc.
- Filed 2023, still PENDING
- Class action + PAGA claims
- Affects all CA hourly employees
- Corroborated by Glassdoor: "company will do whatever it takes to not pay you"

### 5. PROPERTY IN SPECIAL SERVICING
- Confirmed by CRE contact
- Special servicer: K-Star Asset Management (KKR subsidiary)
- Means: Loan in distress or default
- Landlord may not have access to capital for repairs
- Foreclosure is possible

### 6. BBB RATING: D-
- NOT accredited
- 12 complaints in 3 years
- 9 complaints (75%) UNANSWERED
- 1-star customer average
- Pattern: Service failures, withheld refunds, maintenance neglect

### 7. EMPLOYEE REVIEWS: "SHADY"
- Glassdoor: 2.8/5 stars, only 42% recommend
- Quotes:
  - "Shady corporate environment"
  - "Company will do whatever it takes to not pay you"
  - "Properties are short staffed"
  - "Don't follow Fair Housing Laws"

### 8. REGISTERED AGENT CHANGE
- May 2, 2025: Jeffrey Frye removed as registered agent
- Replaced by Michele Saadeh (real estate attorney, 42 years experience)
- Happened 4 months after founder's death
- Possible interpretations: Family asserting control, legal posturing, or standard practice

### 9. HEIR AS DESIGNATED OFFICER
- George Chami Jr. is designated officer on ICI's real estate license
- Lives in upscale Newport Beach
- 21 years as licensed broker
- Family maintains legal control over company license

### 10. REGIONAL DISTRESS PATTERN
- Nearby Clackamas Town Center: $191M default (same market)
- KeyBank involved in both situations
- Oregon retail sector under significant stress

### 11. $2.3M PPP LOAN WITH SUSPICIOUS JOB COUNT
- Received **$2,322,332.50** PPP loan on May 4, 2020
- Claimed **253 jobs** on application
- But company databases show only **21-49 employees**
- That's a **5-10x discrepancy** in job count
- Loan was **100% forgiven** ($2,348,355.35) on June 25, 2021
- Meanwhile: Pending wage theft lawsuit from those same "protected" workers

---

## THE FINANCIAL PICTURE

### Known Financial Hits:
| Item | Amount/Impact |
|------|---------------|
| **PPP Loan (forgiven)** | **+$2,348,355** (taxpayer gift) |
| Johnson settlement | -$3,750,000 paid |
| Perez lawsuit | Unknown (pending) |
| Special servicing | Loan in distress |
| Properties in distress | At least 1 confirmed |
| **Net Position** | **-$1.4M+ before legal fees** |

### Behavioral Indicators of Cash Crunch:
1. **Won't fix roof** despite 8+ months of complaints
2. **Offering 50% rent concession** instead of repairs (preserves cash)
3. **75% of BBB complaints unanswered** (no staff/resources to respond)
4. **Short-staffed properties** (per employees)
5. **Delayed commissions** to employees (per Glassdoor)
6. **Not paying vendors/contractors** (per BBB complaints)

### DSCR Theory:
If company is trying to maintain Debt Service Coverage Ratio:
- Cutting all expenses (including maintenance)
- Keeping tenants at reduced rent vs. losing them entirely
- Not making capital improvements
- Property in special servicing despite these efforts = DSCR still failing

---

## THE GOVERNANCE PICTURE

### Before Founder's Death:
- George Chami Sr.: Founder, Owner, CEO (56 years)
- Clear leadership, single decision-maker

### After Founder's Death (Jan 2025):
| Role | Person | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Owner | UNKNOWN (estate?) | Not publicly disclosed |
| CEO + CFO | Jeffrey Frye | Dual role, reduced authority? |
| Registered Agent | Michele Saadeh | Attorney, brought in May 2025 |
| Designated Officer | George Chami Jr. | Founder's son, controls license |
| Presidents | Sam Benz, George Mobayed | Unclear authority |

### Governance Red Flags:
1. No clear owner disclosed
2. CEO also serves as CFO (no oversight)
3. Outside attorney now registered agent (legal posturing?)
4. Founder's son controls the license
5. Confusing dual-president structure

---

## THE LEGAL PICTURE

### Active/Recent Litigation:
| Case | Type | Status | Amount |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| Johnson v. ICI | Tenant fraud class action | SETTLED | $3,750,000 |
| Perez v. ICI | Employee wage theft | PENDING | Unknown |

### Regulatory Issues:
- D- BBB rating
- Fair Housing violations alleged (per employees)
- PAGA claims = State of California penalties

### Potential Additional Exposure:
- Your commercial tenant claims (unfixed roof, habitability)
- Other tenants with similar issues
- If foreclosure: Lease protections may be affected

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

### The Company Cannot or Will Not Fix Your Roof Because:
1. **They may not have the money** (special servicing = loan in distress)
2. **Capital expenses kill their DSCR** (makes loan situation worse)
3. **No one is empowered to make decisions** (founder dead, leadership unclear)
4. **Pattern of neglect** (BBB complaints, Glassdoor reviews confirm this is systemic)
5. **They'd rather lose you than spend money** (50% concession = buying time)

### Your Leverage:
1. **They need rent revenue** (DSCR depends on it)
2. **They're already in legal trouble** (another lawsuit is bad PR)
3. **They're vulnerable** (distressed company, dead founder, pending litigation)
4. **You have documentation** (8+ months of complaints, 50% concession admission)
5. **Special servicer is watching** (K-Star/KKR monitors everything)

### Nuclear Options:
1. **Contact the special servicer directly** (Angela Johnson, angela.johnson@ksam.com)
2. **File complaint with Oregon BOLI** (habitability issues)
3. **Contact media** (distressed landlord story writes itself)
4. **Contact class action attorneys** (Hogue + Belong, Ferraro Vega already suing ICI)
5. **Organize other tenants** (strength in numbers)

---

## PROPERTY CONDITIONS UPDATE (Dec 17, 2025)

### Oregon City Shopping Center - Widespread Roof Failure
**Source:** User/tenant direct knowledge

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Scope of damage** | EVERY rented space on the property has confirmed roof leaks |
| **Worst affected** | Coastal Farm & Ranch - flooding in basement |
| **Duration** | 8+ months of documented complaints |
| **Landlord response** | 50% rent concession offered instead of repairs |

### What This Indicates:
1. **Systemic roof failure** - not isolated incidents
2. **Deferred maintenance crisis** - property has been neglected
3. **Capital expense avoidance** - roof replacement would cost hundreds of thousands
4. **Possible DSCR manipulation** - deferring maintenance to preserve NOI
5. **Breach of lease obligations** - landlord duty to maintain premises

### Financial Implications:
- Full roof replacement for 210,000 sq ft center: Estimated $1-3 million+
- If property is in special servicing, this expense would further damage DSCR
- Landlord may be deliberately deferring to avoid triggering deeper loan default

### Questions This Raises:
1. Are deferred maintenance reserves being properly funded?
2. Is the company meeting its loan covenants regarding property maintenance?
3. Has the special servicer been informed of the property's condition?
4. Is the CEO/CFO accurately reporting property conditions to lenders?

### Pattern of Exploiting Vulnerable Tenants

**ICI appears to deliberately exhaust tenants until they give up.**

Example: A Thai restaurant at Oregon City Shopping Center, owned by immigrants for whom English is not their first language, has been subjected to the same roof leaks and neglect. Because they:
- Have difficulty navigating the legal/complaint process in English
- Are focused on running their business and can't dedicate time to fighting
- Lack resources to hire attorneys or advocates
- Fear retaliation from their landlord

**The result:** They either:
1. Give up and live with the leaks
2. Pay out of their own pocket for repairs ICI should make
3. Create workarounds that don't fix the underlying problem
4. Exhaust themselves trying to get help and eventually stop asking

**This is not accidental.** When a landlord:
- Ignores complaints for 8+ months
- Fails to respond to 75% of BBB complaints
- Offers "concessions" instead of repairs
- Has a pattern across multiple tenants

...they are counting on tenants giving up. Targeting tenants who face language barriers or have fewer resources to fight back is predatory.

### Potential Legal Implications:
- **Fair Housing Act** - If language/national origin is factor in treatment
- **Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices** - Pattern of deceptive practices
- **Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability** - Commercial lease obligations
- **Constructive Eviction** - Making premises unusable without formally evicting

---

## THE STORY IN ONE PARAGRAPH

*"Investment Concepts Inc., a 56-year-old California real estate company, appears to be in crisis. Its 92-year-old founder died in January 2025 with no apparent succession plan. The company just paid $3.75 million to settle a fraud lawsuit brought by nearly 9,000 tenants, and faces a pending wage theft class action from its own employees. In 2020, ICI received $2.3 million in PPP loans—claiming 253 jobs when business databases show only 21-49 employees—and got the full amount forgiven while allegedly stealing wages from those same workers. At least one of its properties is in special servicing—meaning the loan is in distress and being managed by KKR's special servicing arm. The company has a D- rating from the BBB after failing to respond to 75% of complaints. Its CEO is also its CFO, providing no financial oversight. Employee reviews describe a 'shady corporate environment' where 'the company will do whatever it takes to not pay you.' Four months after the founder's death, the company replaced its CEO as registered agent with a Beverly Hills real estate attorney—suggesting either family intervention or legal posturing. Meanwhile, commercial tenants report unfixed roofs, ignored maintenance requests, and a landlord that offers rent concessions rather than repairs—likely because they can't afford the capital expenditure without further damaging their debt service coverage ratios."*
