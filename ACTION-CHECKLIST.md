**Phone:** 1-877-877-9392

**Your complaint (copy/paste and customize):**
```
I am a commercial tenant at Oregon Center, Oregon City, OR. My landlord is Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI), based at 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865.

COMPLAINT SUMMARY:
Since April 8, 2025—before I even took possession of the space—I have reported chronic roof leaks that remain unresolved after 8+ months. The landlord has engaged in a pattern of:
- Dismissing legitimate complaints
- Making false written statements (claiming we "declined" leak diverters when we did not)
- Failing to perform contractually obligated maintenance
- Telling us to "wait until spring" for repairs despite having April-October to fix the issue

KEY FACTS:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (BEFORE we had keys)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration: 252+ days unresolved
- Adjacent tenant confirms same problem for 2+ YEARS
- Our business sells trading cards (cardboard) - water destroys inventory

ABOUT ICI:
Investment Concepts Inc. manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona — 1.8 million square feet of property. This appears to be a pattern of neglecting maintenance to maximize profit at tenants' expense.

I have extensive documentation: 100+ emails, photographs, video, and ICI's written rent concession letter acknowledging the problem.

DESIRED RESOLUTION:
1. Investigation of ICI's business practices
2. Permanent repair of the roof
3. Rent abatement per lease terms

**Your complaint:**
```
PROPERTY: Oregon Center, Oregon City, OR 97045
OWNER: Oregon Ctr. LLC / Investment Concepts Inc.
ISSUE: Chronic roof failure affecting commercial tenants

I am reporting ongoing building code violations related to roof integrity at Oregon Center shopping plaza.

DETAILS:
- Multiple active roof leaks affecting at least 2 tenant spaces
- Leaks have been reported since April 2025 with no permanent repair
- Adjacent tenant reports same issue for 2+ years
- Water intrusion is ongoing during rain events
- Property owner (Investment Concepts Inc., Orange County CA) has stated roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season"

This represents a failure to maintain the building envelope per Oregon building codes. The ongoing water intrusion may be causing structural damage and creates unsafe conditions for tenants and their customers.

I have photographs, video, and 8 months of email documentation available for inspection.

**WHY THIS MATTERS:** ICI is licensed in California (DRE #00346182). Filing here hits their professional license.

**Your complaint:**
```
RESPONDENT: Investment Concepts Inc.
ADDRESS: 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865
CA DRE LICENSE: #00346182
PRINCIPALS: Jeffrey Frye (CEO/CFO), Kim Watson (COO)

I am filing a complaint against a California-licensed real estate/property management company regarding their management of commercial property in Oregon.

ABOUT THE COMPANY:
Investment Concepts Inc. manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona — approximately 1.8 million square feet of property.

COMPLAINT:
As a tenant at one of their Oregon properties, I have experienced:

1. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPERTY: Chronic roof leaks reported since April 8, 2025 (before I took possession) remain unresolved after 8+ months

2. FALSE STATEMENTS: Property manager Hubert Kim claimed in writing (August 8, 2025) that I "declined" leak diverters. This was false - I have security footage proving otherwise.

3. PATTERN OF NEGLECT: Adjacent tenant confirms same roof problems for 2+ years. I am now connecting with tenants across ICI's portfolio and hearing similar stories. This appears to be systemic.

4. UNREASONABLE DELAYS: Despite having April-October (dry season) to repair, ICI now claims the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season."

ICI's conduct raises questions about their fitness to hold a California real estate license. They are collecting rent on properties they refuse to maintain — across four states.

DOCUMENTATION: 100+ emails, photographs, video, and ICI's written rent concession acknowledging the problem. Available upon request.

**Your complaint:**
```
I am a commercial tenant of Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI) at their Oregon Center property in Oregon City, OR.

ABOUT ICI:
ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across CA, NV, OR, and AZ — 1.8 million square feet of property.

COMPLAINT:
I reported a roof leak on April 8, 2025—BEFORE I even had the keys to my space. ICI acknowledged the problem but handed me the keys anyway. 8+ months later, I have 4 active leaks and have been told to "wait until spring" for repairs.

KEY ISSUES:
- First leak reported before possession (April 8, 2025)
- 8+ months, zero permanent repairs
- Currently 4 active leaks during peak retail season
- Adjacent tenant has same problem for 2+ YEARS
- My business sells trading cards (cardboard) - water destroys inventory
- Property manager made false written claim that I "declined" repairs

ICI is collecting rent on spaces they refuse to maintain. My lease (Section 8a) clearly states roof maintenance is the landlord's responsibility.

DESIRED RESOLUTION:
1. Written repair timeline with specific dates
2. Completion of permanent roof repair
3. Rent abatement for months affected

DOCUMENTATION: Available upon request - 100+ emails, photos, video, landlord's written acknowledgment.

**Your complaint:**
```
Subject: Ethics Complaint Against IREM AMO Member - Investment Concepts Inc.

To the IREM Ethics and Discipline Committee:

I am filing a formal ethics complaint against Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI), which claims IREM AMO accreditation on their website (icicorporate.com).

RESPONDENT:
Investment Concepts Inc.
1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865
(714) 283-5800

COMPANY SCOPE:
ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona — approximately 1.8 million square feet of property.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS:

1. Article 1 (Competence): ICI has failed to demonstrate competent property management by allowing chronic roof leaks to persist for 8+ months at their Oregon Center property (Oregon City, OR), despite repeated reports beginning BEFORE tenant possession.

2. Article 3 (Duty to Owner): While ICI may argue they serve the property owner, their neglect is damaging the property itself through ongoing water intrusion.

3. Article 5 (Truthfulness): ICI's property manager made a false written statement claiming tenant "declined" leak diverters, when no such declination occurred.

4. Article 10 (Compliance with Laws): ICI appears to be violating Oregon landlord-tenant law by failing to maintain the premises in a habitable condition and failing to perform maintenance required by the lease.

FACTS:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (before tenant had keys)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration unresolved: 8+ months
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ years
- ICI's response: "Wait until spring"

I am now connecting with tenants across ICI's portfolio in all four states. Early responses suggest this may be a pattern of conduct, not an isolated incident.

If ICI is an IREM AMO member, their conduct reflects poorly on the organization and violates the Code of Professional Ethics.

# PHASE 2: NEWS MEDIA (Do After Filing Complaints)

**TIP:** File complaints FIRST. Then when you contact media, you can say "We've filed complaints with Oregon DOJ, California DRE, BBB, etc." This shows you're serious and gives them a better story.

**THE ANGLE:** This is no longer just "small business with leaky roof." This is "California company systematically neglecting tenants across 4 states."

**Your pitch:**
```
Subject: Investigative Tip: Small Business vs. Corporate Landlord — Pattern of Neglect Across 4 States

Dear KGW Investigates Team,

I'm reaching out about a story that started with one leaky roof but may be much bigger.

THE QUICK VERSION:
- We're ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles in Oregon City
- We reported our first roof leak on April 8, 2025 - BEFORE we took possession
- The landlord acknowledged it. They handed us the keys anyway.
- 8 months later: 4 active leaks. We were told to "wait until spring."
- Our neighbor (same roof) has had this problem for 2+ YEARS

THE BIGGER STORY:
Our landlord — Investment Concepts Inc. — isn't just managing our building. They manage:
- 29 shopping centers
- 63 apartment buildings
- 1.8 million square feet
- Properties across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona

I've started connecting with other ICI tenants. The pattern is emerging: maintenance ignored, tenants dismissed, rent collected anyway.

THE KICKER:
- Their contractor suggested our leak was "just an old stain." Two more leaks appeared the next morning.
- The property manager claimed IN WRITING that we "declined" leak diverters. That was false.
- They had April through October to fix the roof. They didn't. Now they say "wait until spring."

WHAT WE HAVE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports and dismissals
- Photographs and video of every incident
- Security camera footage disproving management's false claims
- The landlord's written rent concession letter (acknowledging the problem)
- Neighbor testimony confirming 2+ years of the same issue
- We've filed complaints with Oregon DOJ, California DRE, BBB, and IREM

This started as David vs. Goliath. It may be turning into a story about corporate neglect across four states.

Subject: Investigative Tip: Orange County Property Company — Pattern of Tenant Neglect Across 4 States

Dear Mr. Suraci,

I have a story about an Orange County-based company that may interest your investigative team.

Investment Concepts Inc. (1667 E. Lincoln Ave, Orange, CA 92865) manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona — 1.8 million square feet of property.

I am a commercial tenant at one of their Oregon properties, and I have extensively documented what appears to be a pattern of systematic tenant neglect.

MY CASE:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 — BEFORE I even had keys to the space
- Current status: 4 active leaks, 8+ months unresolved
- Landlord's response: "Wait until spring"
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ YEARS
- Property manager made false written claims about repairs I allegedly "declined"

THE BIGGER PICTURE:
I am now reaching out to ICI tenants across their portfolio. Early responses suggest this is not isolated. Online reviews of ICI properties show similar complaints — maintenance ignored, tenants dismissed, problems left to fester.

This is a company headquartered in your backyard that may be systematically neglecting tenants across four states while collecting rent on properties they refuse to maintain.

WHAT I HAVE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports and dismissals
- Photographs and video of every incident
- The landlord's written rent concession letter acknowledging the problem
- Testimony from adjacent tenant confirming years of the same issue
- Security footage disproving management's false claims

Full documentation: https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with your investigative team. This story starts with one leaky roof in Oregon, but it may lead to a pattern of corporate neglect across ICI's entire portfolio.

Dear ABC7 News Team,

I have a story tip about an Orange County-based property management company that may be systematically neglecting tenants across four states.

THE COMPANY:
Investment Concepts Inc.
1667 E. Lincoln Ave, Orange, CA 92865
29 shopping centers, 63 apartment buildings
Properties in CA, NV, OR, AZ

THE STORY:
I am a small business owner renting from ICI in Oregon. I reported a roof leak BEFORE I even had the keys to my space. Eight months later, I have 4 active leaks. The landlord told me to "wait until spring."

My neighbor — same roof, same landlord — has had this problem for over TWO YEARS.

I am now connecting with ICI tenants across their portfolio. The pattern is emerging: maintenance ignored, tenants dismissed, problems left to fester while rent is collected.

THE ANGLE:
An Orange County company managing nearly 2 million square feet of property across four states — and tenants say they can't get basic maintenance done.

Subject: Oregon City Small Business Needs Your Help — Out-of-State Landlord Neglect

Mayor McGriff,

I'm Mike Alarcon, co-owner of ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles at Oregon Center. I'm writing because a California corporation is neglecting an Oregon City property and its small business tenants.

Our situation: We reported a roof leak before we even had the keys to our space (April 8, 2025). 8 months later, we have 4 active leaks. Our landlord — Investment Concepts Inc. from Orange County, CA — has told us to "wait until spring."

Our neighbor, a Thai restaurant, has had the same problem for over 2 years.

ABOUT THE LANDLORD:
ICI isn't just managing our building. They manage 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across CA, NV, OR, and AZ. This appears to be how they operate — collect rent, ignore maintenance.

This is an out-of-state corporation collecting rent on Oregon City properties while refusing to maintain them. We've filed complaints with multiple agencies, but I wanted you to be aware of the situation.

We're not asking for anything extraordinary — just a roof that doesn't leak.

**Remember:** The goal is to make ignoring you more expensive than fixing the roof.

This is no longer just about your roof. This is about exposing a pattern of corporate neglect across 4 states and 92 properties.

Every complaint creates a paper trail. Every media inquiry makes them nervous. Every review affects their reputation. Every tenant who joins makes the story bigger.

Go get 'em.
