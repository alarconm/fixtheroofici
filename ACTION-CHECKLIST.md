# PHASE 1: OFFICIAL COMPLAINTS (Do First - Creates Paper Trail)

## [ ] 1. Oregon DOJ Consumer Protection
**Link:** https://justice.oregon.gov/consumercomplaints/OnlineComplaints/OnlineComplaintForm/en
**Phone:** 1-877-877-9392

**Your complaint (copy/paste and customize):**
```
I am a commercial tenant at Oregon Center, Oregon City, OR. My landlord is Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI), based at 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865.

COMPLAINT SUMMARY:
Since April 8, 2025—before I even took possession of the space—I have reported chronic roof leaks that remain unresolved after 8+ months. The landlord has engaged in a pattern of:
- Dismissing legitimate complaints
- Making false written statements (claiming we "declined" leak diverters when we did not)
- Failing to perform contractually obligated maintenance
- Telling us to "wait until spring" for repairs despite having April-October to fix the issue

KEY FACTS:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (BEFORE we had keys)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration: 252+ days unresolved
- Adjacent tenant confirms same problem for 2+ YEARS
- Our business sells trading cards (cardboard) - water destroys inventory

ICI is a $9M/year property management company. This appears to be a pattern of neglecting maintenance to maximize profit at tenants' expense.

I have extensive documentation: 100+ emails, photographs, video, and ICI's written rent concession letter acknowledging the problem.

DESIRED RESOLUTION:
1. Investigation of ICI's business practices
2. Permanent repair of the roof
3. Rent abatement per lease terms
```

## [ ] 2. Oregon Building Codes Division
**Link:** https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/enforcement/pages/complaint.aspx
**Phone:** 503-378-3278

**Your complaint:**
```
PROPERTY: Oregon Center, Oregon City, OR 97045
OWNER: Oregon Ctr. LLC / Investment Concepts Inc.
ISSUE: Chronic roof failure affecting commercial tenants

I am reporting ongoing building code violations related to roof integrity at Oregon Center shopping plaza.

DETAILS:
- Multiple active roof leaks affecting at least 2 tenant spaces
- Leaks have been reported since April 2025 with no permanent repair
- Adjacent tenant reports same issue for 2+ years
- Water intrusion is ongoing during rain events
- Property owner (Investment Concepts Inc., Orange County CA) has stated roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season"

This represents a failure to maintain the building envelope per Oregon building codes. The ongoing water intrusion may be causing structural damage and creates unsafe conditions for tenants and their customers.

I have photographs, video, and 8 months of email documentation available for inspection.

## [ ] 5. California Department of Real Estate (DRE)
**Link:** https://eocs.dre.ca.gov/
**Phone:** 1-877-373-4542

**WHY THIS MATTERS:** ICI is licensed in California. Filing here hits their professional license.

**Your complaint:**
```
RESPONDENT: Investment Concepts Inc.
ADDRESS: 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865
PRINCIPALS: Jeffrey Frye (CEO/CFO), Kim Watson (COO)

I am filing a complaint against a California-licensed real estate/property management company regarding their management of commercial property in Oregon.

COMPLAINT:
Investment Concepts Inc. manages Oregon Center in Oregon City, OR. As a tenant, I have experienced:

1. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPERTY: Chronic roof leaks reported since April 8, 2025 (before I took possession) remain unresolved after 8+ months

2. FALSE STATEMENTS: Property manager Hubert Kim claimed in writing (August 8, 2025) that I "declined" leak diverters. This was false - I have security footage proving otherwise.

3. PATTERN OF NEGLECT: Adjacent tenant confirms same roof problems for 2+ years. This is not an isolated incident but a pattern of failing to maintain properties.

4. UNREASONABLE DELAYS: Despite having April-October (dry season) to repair, ICI now claims the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season."

ICI's conduct raises questions about their fitness to hold a California real estate license. They are collecting rent on properties they refuse to maintain.

DOCUMENTATION: 100+ emails, photographs, video, and ICI's written rent concession acknowledging the problem. Available upon request.

- Name: Investment Concepts Inc.
- Address: 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865
- Phone: (714) 283-5800

**Your complaint:**
```
I am a commercial tenant of Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI) at their Oregon Center property in Oregon City, OR.

COMPLAINT:
I reported a roof leak on April 8, 2025—BEFORE I even had the keys to my space. ICI acknowledged the problem but handed me the keys anyway. 8+ months later, I have 4 active leaks and have been told to "wait until spring" for repairs.

KEY ISSUES:
- First leak reported before possession (April 8, 2025)
- 8+ months, zero permanent repairs
- Currently 4 active leaks during peak retail season
- Adjacent tenant has same problem for 2+ YEARS
- My business sells trading cards (cardboard) - water destroys inventory
- Property manager made false written claim that I "declined" repairs

ICI is a property management company collecting rent on spaces they refuse to maintain. My lease (Section 8a) clearly states roof maintenance is the landlord's responsibility.

DESIRED RESOLUTION:
1. Written repair timeline with specific dates
2. Completion of permanent roof repair
3. Rent abatement for months affected

DOCUMENTATION: Available upon request - 100+ emails, photos, video, landlord's written acknowledgment.

## [ ] 7. IREM Ethics Complaint
**Link:** https://www.irem.org/contact
**Why:** ICI claims to be an "IREM Accredited Management Organization"

**Email to:** ethics@irem.org (or use contact form)

**Your complaint:**
```
Subject: Ethics Complaint Against IREM AMO Member - Investment Concepts Inc.

To the IREM Ethics and Discipline Committee:

I am filing a formal ethics complaint against Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI), which claims IREM AMO accreditation on their website (icicorporate.com).

RESPONDENT:
Investment Concepts Inc.
1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865
(714) 283-5800

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS:

1. Article 1 (Competence): ICI has failed to demonstrate competent property management by allowing chronic roof leaks to persist for 8+ months at their Oregon Center property (Oregon City, OR), despite repeated reports beginning BEFORE tenant possession.

2. Article 3 (Duty to Owner): While ICI may argue they serve the property owner, their neglect is damaging the property itself through ongoing water intrusion.

3. Article 5 (Truthfulness): ICI's property manager made a false written statement claiming tenant "declined" leak diverters, when no such declination occurred.

4. Article 10 (Compliance with Laws): ICI appears to be violating Oregon landlord-tenant law by failing to maintain the premises in a habitable condition and failing to perform maintenance required by the lease.

FACTS:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (before tenant had keys)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration unresolved: 8+ months
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ years
- ICI's response: "Wait until spring"

If ICI is an IREM AMO member, their conduct reflects poorly on the organization and violates the Code of Professional Ethics.

Full documentation available upon request.

# PHASE 2: NEWS MEDIA (Do After Filing Complaints)

**TIP:** File complaints FIRST. Then when you contact media, you can say "We've filed complaints with Oregon DOJ, California DRE, BBB, etc." This shows you're serious and gives them a better story.

**Email:** newstips@kgw.com
**Investigative reporter:** Kyle Iboshi

**Your pitch:**
```
Subject: Investigative Tip: Oregon City Small Business vs. Corporate Landlord - 8 Months of Documented Neglect

Dear KGW Investigates Team,

I'm reaching out about a story with extensive documentation: a small business owner who reported a roof leak BEFORE he even had the keys, and 8 months later has 4 active leaks while his corporate landlord tells him to "wait until spring."

THE QUICK VERSION:
- We're ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles in Oregon City
- We sell Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, sports cards - cardboard that water destroys
- We reported our first leak on April 8, 2025 - during buildout, BEFORE we took possession
- The landlord acknowledged it. The roofer came. It wasn't fixed. They handed us the keys anyway.
- 8 months later: 4 active leaks during our peak holiday retail season
- Our neighbor (Thai restaurant, same roof) has had this problem for 2+ YEARS

THE LANDLORD:
Investment Concepts Inc. - a $9M/year property management company based in Orange County, California (1,400 miles away). They claim to be IREM-accredited.

THE KICKER:
- Their contractor suggested our leak was "just an old stain." Two more leaks appeared the next morning.
- The property manager claimed IN WRITING that we "declined" leak diverters. That was false - we have security footage.
- They had April through October to fix the roof. They didn't. Now they say "wait until spring."

WHAT WE HAVE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports and dismissals
- Photographs of every incident
- Video of active leaks
- Security camera footage
- The landlord's written rent concession letter (acknowledging the problem)
- Neighbor testimony confirming 2+ years of the same issue
- We've filed complaints with Oregon DOJ, California DRE, BBB, and IREM

THE HUMAN ANGLE:
Three people trying to build a small business, hosting weekly Magic tournaments, creating community - watching their dream threatened because a corporate landlord 1,400 miles away won't maintain their building.

This is a David vs. Goliath story with a paper trail.

Available for interview, store tour, and full document review at your convenience.

Subject: Oregon City Small Business Needs Your Help - Out-of-State Landlord Neglect

Mayor McGriff,

I'm Mike Alarcon, co-owner of ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles at Oregon Center. I'm writing because a California corporation is neglecting an Oregon City property and its small business tenants.

Our situation: We reported a roof leak before we even had the keys to our space (April 8, 2025). 8 months later, we have 4 active leaks. Our landlord - Investment Concepts Inc. from Orange County, CA - has told us to "wait until spring."

Our neighbor, a Thai restaurant, has had the same problem for over 2 years.

This is an out-of-state corporation collecting rent on Oregon City properties while refusing to maintain them. We've filed complaints with multiple agencies, but I wanted you to be aware of the situation.

We're not asking for anything extraordinary - just a roof that doesn't leak.

Full documentation: https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you or your office.

Clackamas County Commissioners,

I'm writing to alert you to a situation at Oregon Center in Oregon City where an out-of-state property management company (Investment Concepts Inc., Orange County, CA) is neglecting commercial tenants.

As a small business owner, I've documented 8+ months of unresolved roof leaks - starting before I even took possession. My neighbor has had the same problem for 2+ years. The landlord's response: "Wait until spring."

This raises concerns about out-of-state commercial property owners neglecting Clackamas County buildings and businesses.
