# PART 1: VIRAL-OPTIMIZED SCRIPTS

## THE PSYCHOLOGY OF VIRAL CONTENT

What makes people stop scrolling:
- **Conflict** (David vs Goliath)
- **Injustice** (outrage fuel)
- **Secrets exposed** ("what we found will shock you")
- **Relatable struggle** (small business, immigrant story)
- **Numbers that hit hard** ($3.75 MILLION)
- **Pattern interrupts** (unexpected reveals)

---

## SCRIPT A: "THE RECEIPTS" (Best for TikTok/Reels - 60 sec)

### HOOK OPTIONS (Test these - post same video with different hooks)

**Hook 1 (Curiosity Gap):**
"Our landlord handed us keys to a building they KNEW was broken. Here's the receipts."

**Hook 2 (Controversy):**
"A California corporation is exploiting immigrant business owners in Oregon and I have proof."

**Hook 3 (Numbers):**
"$3.75 MILLION. That's how much our landlord paid to settle a FRAUD lawsuit. And they're doing it again."

**Hook 4 (Story):**
"I reported a leaking roof before I even had keys to my business. That was 8 months ago. Watch this."

**Hook 5 (Outrage):**
"They're targeting tenants who don't speak English because they know they won't fight back."

---

### SCRIPT (After Hook)

**[0:03-0:10] THE SETUP**
"We're a small trading card shop in Oregon. We sell cardboard—the kind water destroys instantly. Our landlord is 1,400 miles away in California."

**[0:10-0:20] THE ESCALATION**
"We reported leaks in APRIL. Before we even had keys. They handed us the keys anyway.

Eight months later? *[hold up four fingers]* Four. Active. Leaks."

**[0:20-0:35] THE NEIGHBOR REVEAL (Emotional Peak)**
"But here's what broke me.

Our neighbor—a Thai restaurant—has had the SAME problem for over TWO YEARS.

*[pause, let it land]*

They stopped reporting it. Because English isn't their first language. And nobody. Was. Listening."

**[0:35-0:50] THE EXPOSE**
"So I started digging. And I found:

*[count on fingers, fast cuts work here]*
- A three-point-seven-five MILLION dollar fraud settlement
- A wage theft lawsuit from their OWN employees
- A D-MINUS BBB rating
- The CEO is also the CFO—same person, no oversight
- And the property is in special servicing—meaning even the BANK thinks they're failing"

**[0:50-0:60] THE CTA**
"They're betting we'll give up. We won't.

Link in bio. Share this. And if you want to really help? Go eat at Sap Sap Thai next door. They deserve it.

## SCRIPT B: "STORYTIME" FORMAT (Best for longer Facebook/YouTube)

### TITLE/THUMBNAIL TEXT:
"I Found Out My Landlord is a Fraud (Exposed)"

---

**[COLD OPEN - 5 sec]**
*[Show photo of ceiling damage]*
"This is my business. This is what eight months of being ignored looks like."

**[INTRO - 15 sec]**
"Hey everyone. I need to tell you about something, and I need your help spreading the word.

My name is Mike. My family runs a small trading card shop called ORB in Oregon City. We opened this year. It was supposed to be our dream."

**[THE PROBLEM - 30 sec]**
"April 8th, 2025. We're still building out our space. We don't even have the keys yet. And I notice water damage on our brand new ceiling.

I report it immediately. The landlord acknowledges it. Sends a roofer.

*[pause]*

They handed us the keys anyway. The leak wasn't fixed.

That was eight months ago. Since then? It's gotten worse. And worse. And worse. We now have FOUR active leaks—during our busiest season—directly over inventory that water destroys instantly."

**[THE NEIGHBOR - 45 sec]**
"But here's where the story changes.

A few weeks ago, I talked to our neighbors. The Thai restaurant next door. Same building. Same roof. Same landlord.

They've had leaks for over TWO YEARS.

*[let it land]*

Two years. And you know why they stopped fighting? Because English isn't their first language. And every time they tried to get help, nothing happened. They gave up.

And that's when I realized—this isn't incompetence. This is a strategy. They're counting on people like my neighbors—immigrants, small business owners without resources—to just... give up."

**[THE INVESTIGATION - 60 sec]**
"So I did what anyone would do. I started Googling. And what I found made my stomach turn.

Our landlord is a company called Investment Concepts Inc. Based in Orange County, California. 1,400 miles from here.

In October 2024—just a few months before we signed our lease—they paid $3.75 MILLION to settle a class action lawsuit. Nearly 9,000 tenants accused them of fraud. Stealing security deposits. Making up charges. Falsifying documents.

They settled. $3.75 million.

But wait, there's more.

Their own EMPLOYEES are suing them. For wage theft. A current lawsuit, still pending.

They have a D-MINUS rating with the Better Business Bureau. Why? Because they don't respond to 75% of complaints.

The founder of the company died in January. 92 years old. No succession plan. Now the CEO is also the CFO—the same person controls everything with no oversight.

And the property we're in? It's in what's called 'special servicing'—which means the LENDERS think this loan is in trouble. They might not even have the money to fix the roof if they wanted to."

**[THE PATTERN - 30 sec]**
"Here's what I've figured out.

This company has a playbook:
1. Ignore the complaint
2. Send someone to 'look at it'
3. Do nothing
4. Wait for the tenant to give up
5. Repeat

They target people who can't fight back. Small businesses. Immigrants. People who don't have lawyers on speed dial.

And they're renting out spaces they KNOW are broken. They're collecting rent while misrepresenting the condition of the property. That's not just negligence. That's fraud."

**[THE ASK - 30 sec]**
"So here's what I'm asking.

**Number one:** Share this video. Share our website. We documented EVERYTHING—emails, photos, the corporate research. It's all at fixtheroofici.replit.app. Link in my bio, link in the comments.

**Number two:** If you're an ICI tenant ANYWHERE—California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon—reach out. We're building a coalition. You're not alone.

**Number three:** If you really want to support us, go get a meal at Sap Sap Thai right next door. They've been dealing with this longer than us, they can't fight back, and they deserve your business.

We're not going away. And the more people who see this, the harder it is for them to keep ignoring us.

## SCRIPT C: "THE DUET/STITCH BAIT" (Designed to go viral through responses)

**[15 seconds, provocative]**

"Landlords, explain this.

I reported a leaking roof BEFORE I had keys. You handed me the keys anyway.

Eight months later, four active leaks.

My neighbor has had the same problem for TWO YEARS but stopped reporting because English isn't their first language and you don't listen.

You just paid $3.75 million for defrauding tenants. Your employees are suing you for wage theft. You have a D-minus BBB rating.

And your response? 'Wait until spring.'

## SCRIPT D: "THE THREAD/CAROUSEL" (Instagram/Twitter/Threads)

**Post 1 (Hook):**
"I'm about to expose what happens when a California corporation decides immigrant small business owners aren't worth listening to.

A thread about corporate neglect, a $3.75M fraud settlement, and why we're not staying quiet.

#FixTheRoofICI"

**Post 2:**
"April 8, 2025: We report a roof leak at our new shop. We don't even have keys yet.

The landlord acknowledges it. Sends a roofer. Doesn't fix it. Hands us the keys anyway.

That was 8 months ago."

**Post 3:**
"Today: 4 active leaks. Peak holiday season. Buckets on the sales floor. $50k+ in cardboard inventory at risk.

Their response? 'Wait until spring.'"

**Post 4:**
"But it gets worse.

Our neighbor—a Thai restaurant—has had the SAME leaks for 2+ YEARS.

They stopped reporting because English isn't their first language and nobody was listening.

This isn't incompetence. It's a strategy."

**Post 5:**
"So I investigated our landlord: Investment Concepts Inc. (Orange County, CA)

What I found:
- $3.75M fraud settlement (Oct 2024)
- Pending wage theft lawsuit
- D- BBB rating
- 75% of complaints IGNORED
- Founder died, no succession plan
- CEO = CFO (no oversight)"

**Post 6:**
"The property is in 'special servicing'—meaning the LENDERS think the loan is failing.

They might not even have the money to fix the roof.

But they're still collecting rent. Still renting to new tenants. Still ignoring complaints."

**Post 7:**
"What we need:

1. SHARE this thread
2. Visit fixtheroofici.replit.app (full documentation)
3. Support Sap Sap Thai next door
4. If you're an ICI tenant anywhere—reach out

They're betting we'll give up. We won't."

# PART 2: STEP-BY-STEP POSTING GUIDE

## BEFORE YOU FILM

### Equipment Needed:
- Smartphone (that's it—authenticity > production quality)
- Good lighting (face a window, or use ring light)
- Quiet space
- Phone tripod or something to prop phone (optional but helpful)

### What to Wear:
- Something casual, relatable
- Your ORB shirt/merch if you have it
- NO sunglasses (eye contact matters)

### Your Background:
- BEST: Film IN THE STORE with the damage visible behind you
- Show the buckets, the missing ceiling tiles, the leak diverters
- Authenticity is everything—messy/real > polished/fake

---

## FILMING TIPS

### Energy & Delivery:
1. **Start HIGH energy**—the first 1-3 seconds determine if people keep watching
2. **Talk like you're telling a friend**—not reading a script
3. **Use hand gestures**—keeps visual interest
4. **Vary your pace**—slow down for emotional moments, speed up for lists
5. **Look at the camera lens**—not the screen (this is eye contact)
6. **Show emotion**—if you're frustrated, let it show. Authenticity wins.

### Technical:
- Film VERTICAL (9:16) for TikTok/Reels/Shorts
- Film in 1080p or higher
- Keep phone stable
- Good audio is more important than good video

### Pattern Interrupts (Keep People Watching):
- Cut to photos/videos of damage
- Show documents on screen
- Hold up fingers when counting
- Change camera angle
- Add text overlays in editing

---

## EDITING

### Free Apps:
- **CapCut** (best for TikTok-style, free, lots of features)
- **InShot** (simple, good for beginners)
- **VN Video Editor** (more advanced, still free)

### Must-Add Elements:
1. **Captions/Subtitles** - 80%+ of people watch without sound
2. **Text overlays** for key stats ($3.75M, D- rating, etc.)
3. **B-roll** - Cut to photos of damage, documents, the building
4. **Music** - Use trending sounds (see below) or emotional music

### Trending Sounds to Consider:
- Search TikTok for: "storytime sounds" "expose sounds" "dramatic sounds"
- News broadcast sounds work great for investigation-style
- Avoid copyrighted music (stick to TikTok's library)

Our landlord knew the roof leaked before we even had keys. They handed us the keys anyway.

8 months later: 4 active leaks. $50k+ in inventory at risk.

But here's what really got me—our neighbors, a Thai restaurant, have dealt with this for 2+ YEARS. They stopped fighting because English isn't their first language and nobody was listening.

So I investigated. What I found:
- $3.75M fraud settlement
- Pending wage theft lawsuit
- D- BBB rating
- Founder died, no succession plan
- CEO is also CFO (no oversight)

They're betting we'll give up. We won't.

I need your help sharing this.

We run a small trading card shop in Oregon City. In April, before we even had keys to our space, we reported a leaking roof. The landlord acknowledged it. They handed us the keys anyway.

Eight months later, we have FOUR active leaks. During our busiest season. Over inventory that water destroys instantly.

But here's what really broke me: our neighbors—a Thai restaurant—have had the same problem for over TWO YEARS. They stopped fighting because English isn't their first language and their problems never got resolved.

So I started investigating our landlord—Investment Concepts Inc., based in Orange County, California (1,400 miles away).

What I found:
- They just paid $3.75 MILLION to settle a fraud lawsuit (9,000 tenants affected)
- Their own employees are suing them for wage theft
- They have a D- BBB rating (75% of complaints go unanswered)
- The founder died this year with no succession plan
- The CEO is also the CFO (no independent oversight)
- Our property is in "special servicing"—the lenders think the loan is in trouble

This isn't incompetence. This is a company that targets small businesses and immigrants who don't have the resources to fight back.

We documented everything: fixtheroofici.replit.app

What you can do:
1. SHARE this post
2. If you're an ICI tenant anywhere (CA, NV, AZ, OR)—reach out
3. If you want to really support us, go get a meal at Sap Sap Thai next door

We're not going away.

6. **"Things my landlord said vs. reality"** (side by side their claims vs truth)

7. **"Going live from my leaking business"** (authenticity)

- The Thai restaurant (with their permission)
- You working in the store despite conditions
- Rainy days showing the problem
- Any repair attempts that failed

# PART 4: MESSAGING FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT

## Core Narrative (What people will remember):

**One sentence:** "A California corporation is exploiting immigrant small business owners and collecting rent on buildings they know are broken."

**Three facts people remember:**
1. $3.75 million fraud settlement
2. Neighbors have had leaks for 2+ years
3. They target people who can't fight back

## Emotional Beats to Hit:

1. **Injustice** - "They KNEW and gave us keys anyway"
2. **Underdog** - "Small family business vs California corporation"
3. **Solidarity** - "Our immigrant neighbors were ignored"
4. **Exposure** - "Here's what I found when I investigated"
5. **Empowerment** - "We're not going away"

## Words/Phrases That Work:

- "Receipts" / "The receipts"
- "Exposed"
- "They're betting we'll give up"
- "Out-of-state corporation"
