# THE STORY (Copy/Paste Ready)

**Short version (social media):**
We're a small trading card shop. We reported our first roof leak BEFORE WE EVEN HAD THE KEYS. Eight months later, we have four active leaks. All we're asking for is a roof that doesn't leak. Our out-of-state corporate landlord told us to "wait until spring."

**Full version (news/media):**
We're a small family-run business running ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles in Oregon City, Oregon. We sell Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, sports cards—cardboard products that water destroys instantly.

We reported our first roof leak on April 8, 2025—**during buildout, before we even had the keys**. The landlord acknowledged it. The roofer was dispatched. It wasn't fixed. They handed us the keys anyway.

Eight months later, we have **four active leaks** during our peak retail season. The landlord—Investment Concepts Inc., based in Orange County, California—has told us the roof "can't be repaired until after the rainy season." They had April through October to fix it. They didn't.

We're not asking for anything extraordinary. We're asking for what our lease promises: a roof that works. That's it.

Our neighbor—a Thai restaurant sharing the same roof—has dealt with this for **over 2 years**. This isn't a one-time problem. This is a pattern of neglect.

**THE BIGGER PICTURE:**
ICI isn't just managing our building. They manage **29 shopping centers** and **63 apartment buildings** across **California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona** — 1.8 million square feet. We're connecting with tenants across their portfolio and hearing the same stories.

# DAMNING QUOTES (Use Everywhere)

## 1. "Old Stain"
> "My roofers went out there. There was no signs of wetness. The tile was completely dry. **It might've been an old stain??**"
> — Ray Deal, Leak Seal Roofing, May 16, 2025

**The kicker:** TWO NEW LEAKS appeared the next morning. Those tiles were brand new.

## 2. The False Statement
> "[We] offered to install leak diverters... **but they were declined.**"
> — Hubert Kim (ICI Property Manager), August 8, 2025

**Brandon's response:** "Because they were absolutely not declined by us." We offered to pull security video with audio to prove it.

## 3. Wait Until Spring
> "The roof cannot be repaired until after the rainy season."
> — ICI Management, December 2025

They had April through October. They didn't fix it. Now it's our problem.

## 4. We Predicted This
> "I am worried that we are going to get a patch here and there then **when the rainy season hits in the fall we're going to have a continual loop of leaks**..."
> — Mike Alarcon (ORB), May 16, 2025

Written in May. It's December. Four leaks. We were right.

# LINKEDIN POST

I need to share something difficult.

I'm part of a small team running a trading card shop in Oregon City. We sell Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, sports cards—cardboard products that water destroys instantly.

We reported our first roof leak on April 8, 2025.

**Before we even had the keys.**

The landlord acknowledged it. The roofer was dispatched. It wasn't fixed. They handed us the keys anyway.

Eight months later, we have four active leaks during our peak retail season.

Here's what we've experienced:

→ The roofing contractor suggested our leak was "just an old stain." Two more leaks appeared the next morning.

→ When we reported those, we were told: "It helps if you answer the questions." We had answered every question.

→ The property manager claimed in writing that we "declined" leak diverters. That was false—we have security footage.

→ Now we're told the roof "can't be repaired until after the rainy season." They had April through October.

This week, we learned our neighbor—a Thai restaurant sharing the same roof—has dealt with this for **over 2 years**.

Our landlord is Investment Concepts Inc., based in Orange County, California.

We're not asking for anything extraordinary. We're asking for a roof that doesn't leak. That's it.

1/ We reported a roof leak before we even had the keys.

That was April 8, 2025.

It's now December. We have four active leaks.

All we want is a roof that doesn't leak.

🧵 #FixTheRoofICI

2/ We're @ORBSportsCards, a small trading card shop in Oregon City.

We sell Magic, Pokémon, sports cards—cardboard that water destroys instantly.

When we signed our lease, we expected basic maintenance.

We expected a roof that works.

3/ April 8, 2025: We reported a leak during buildout.

BEFORE WE HAD KEYS.

The landlord acknowledged it. The roofer came out.

It wasn't fixed.

They handed us the keys anyway.

4/ May 16: Another leak, above expensive product.

The contractor's response: "It might've been an old stain??"

Those tiles were brand new.

The next morning: TWO MORE LEAKS.

5/ When we reported those, the contractor said:

"It helps if you answer the questions."

We had answered every question. Sent photos. Detailed everything.

We were being dismissed.

6/ August: Property manager claimed IN WRITING that we "declined" leak diverters.

Brandon responded: "Because they were absolutely not declined by us."

We offered to pull security video.

They stopped making that claim.

7/ December 2025: Four active leaks.

Peak retail season. Buckets on the sales floor.

Their solution? "Wait until spring."

They had April-October to fix this. They didn't.

8/ This week we talked to our neighbor—a Thai restaurant, same roof.

They've had the SAME PROBLEM for 2+ YEARS.

Same landlord. Same neglect.

This building's roof has been broken for years. They collect rent anyway.

9/ Our landlord: Investment Concepts Inc.
Based in: Orange County, CA (1,400 miles away)
CEO: Jeffrey Frye
COO: Kim Watson

All we're asking for: A roof that doesn't leak.

Full documentation: https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

10/ We're not asking for free rent.
We're not asking for damages.
We're not trying to get out of our lease.

We just want what we're paying for: a dry ceiling.

# NEWS MEDIA EMAIL

**Subject:** Small Business Documents 8 Months of Landlord Neglect — Leak Reported Before They Had Keys

Dear [News Team],

I'm reaching out about a local story with extensive documentation: a small trading card shop in Oregon City reported a roof leak **before they even had the keys** in April 2025. Eight months later, they have four active leaks, and their out-of-state corporate landlord has told them to "wait until spring."

**The quick pitch:**
- Small business (ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles) vs. California-based corporate landlord (Investment Concepts Inc., Orange County)
- First leak reported April 8, 2025 — BEFORE taking possession
- Landlord knew, handed over keys anyway
- 8+ months, 0 permanent fixes, now 4 active leaks
- Contractor questioned if they knew what a leak was; two more leaks appeared the next day
- Adjacent tenant (Thai restaurant) has had same problem for 2+ YEARS
- All inventory is cardboard — water destroys everything
- Now told "wait until spring" during peak retail season

**What they're asking for:** A roof that doesn't leak. That's it.

I have full documentation: 100+ emails, photographs, video, the landlord's written rent concession (acknowledging the problem), and testimony from the adjacent tenant confirming this is a building-wide, years-long issue.

**The human angle:** A small team trying to build something—hosting Magic: The Gathering tournaments, building community—watching water threaten their dream because a corporate landlord 1,400 miles away won't maintain their building.

Available for interview, store tour, and full document review.

**All We Want Is A Roof That Doesn't Leak**

I'm a commercial tenant at an ICI property in Oregon. We reported our first roof leak in April 2025—before we even had the keys. The landlord knew and handed us the keys anyway.

8 months later: 4 active leaks. Their solution? "Wait until spring."

Their contractor suggested our leak was "just an old stain." The next day: two more leaks.

Our neighbor (same roof) has had this problem for 2+ YEARS.

We're not asking for anything unreasonable. Just a roof that works. Apparently that's too much.

**The goal:** Make ignoring you more expensive than fixing the roof.

Good luck. You've got this. 🎯
