**Complaint Description (copy this):**

```
I am a commercial tenant at Oregon Center, Oregon City, OR. My landlord is Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI), a property management company based at 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865.

ABOUT ICI:
Investment Concepts Inc. manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona — 1.8 million square feet of property. What I am experiencing appears to be a pattern of conduct, not an isolated incident.

COMPLAINT SUMMARY:
Since April 8, 2025—before I even took possession of the space—I have reported chronic roof leaks that remain unresolved after 8+ months. The landlord has engaged in a pattern of unfair and deceptive business practices including:

1. FAILURE TO DISCLOSE KNOWN DEFECT: ICI rented me a commercial space knowing the roof leaked. The first leak was reported April 8, 2025, BEFORE I had keys. They acknowledged it, dispatched a roofer, failed to fix it, and handed me the keys anyway.

2. FALSE STATEMENTS: On August 8, 2025, ICI Property Manager Hubert Kim stated in writing that I "declined" leak diverters. This was demonstrably false. I have security camera footage proving no such offer was declined.

3. PATTERN OF NEGLECT: My adjacent tenant (a Thai restaurant sharing the same roof) confirms they have had the SAME roof leak problem for over 2 YEARS. I am now connecting with ICI tenants across their portfolio in all four states and hearing similar stories.

4. UNREASONABLE DELAYS: ICI had April through October 2025 (the dry season) to repair the roof. They did not. Now they claim the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season," leaving me with 4 active leaks during my peak retail season.

KEY FACTS:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (BEFORE I had keys to the space)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration unresolved: 252+ days
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ YEARS
- My business: Trading cards (cardboard products that water destroys)
- ICI's response: "Wait until spring"

I have extensive documentation available:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports and dismissals
- Photographs of every leak incident
- Video of active water intrusion
- Security camera footage
- ICI's written rent concession letter (acknowledging the problem)
- Lease agreement showing roof maintenance is landlord's responsibility (Section 8a)
- Testimony from adjacent tenant confirming 2+ year pattern

DESIRED RESOLUTION:
1. Investigation of ICI's business practices across their portfolio
2. Permanent repair of the roof as required by our lease
3. Rent abatement for the period affected per lease terms

DOCUMENTATION: Available upon request. Full timeline at https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

PROPERTY INFORMATION:
Property Name: Oregon Center (shopping plaza)

Owner Address: 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865

Business: ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles
Address: Oregon Center, Suite 127, Oregon City, OR 97045
Phone: 503-389-5404
Email: mike@orbsportscards.com

COMPLAINT:
I am reporting ongoing building code violations related to roof integrity and water intrusion at Oregon Center shopping plaza in Oregon City.

NATURE OF VIOLATION:
Multiple chronic roof leaks affecting at least 2 commercial tenant spaces with no permanent repair for extended periods (8+ months for my space, 2+ years for adjacent tenant). This represents a failure to maintain the building envelope per Oregon building codes.

SPECIFIC ISSUES:
1. Active water intrusion through the roof during rain events
2. 4 separate leak locations currently active in my suite alone
3. Water damage to interior ceiling tiles and potential structural elements
4. Adjacent tenant (Thai restaurant) reports same roof leak issues for over 2 years
5. Property owner (out-of-state) refuses to make permanent repairs

PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSE:
Investment Concepts Inc. (Orange County, CA) has stated the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season" despite having the entire dry season (April-October) to address the issue.

Note: ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across CA, NV, OR, and AZ. This appears to be a pattern of neglect, not an isolated incident.

I have photographs, video, and 8 months of email documentation available for inspection.

COMPANY SCOPE:

COMPLAINANT INFORMATION:
Name: Mike Alarcon
Business: ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles
Address: Oregon Center, Suite 127, Oregon City, OR 97045
Phone: 503-389-5404
Email: mike@orbsportscards.com

NATURE OF COMPLAINT:
I am filing a complaint against Investment Concepts Inc., a California-licensed real estate and property management company, regarding their management of commercial property in Oregon City, Oregon.

SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS:

1. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPERTY
ICI manages Oregon Center shopping plaza in Oregon City, OR. As a commercial tenant, I reported a roof leak on April 8, 2025—BEFORE I even took possession of the space. ICI acknowledged the problem, dispatched a roofer, but failed to repair it before handing me the keys. 8+ months later, I have 4 active leaks and have been told to "wait until spring."

2. MISREPRESENTATION / FALSE STATEMENTS
On August 8, 2025, ICI Property Manager Hubert Kim stated in writing that I "declined" leak diverters offered to mitigate the problem. This statement was false. I have security camera footage with audio proving no such offer was declined.

3. PATTERN OF NEGLECT ACROSS PORTFOLIO
My adjacent tenant (a Thai restaurant sharing the same roof) confirms they have experienced the SAME roof leak problem for over 2 YEARS. I am now connecting with ICI tenants across their 4-state portfolio and hearing similar stories. This appears to be systemic corporate neglect.

4. FAILURE TO PERFORM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Per our lease agreement (Section 8a), roof maintenance is explicitly the landlord's responsibility. ICI has failed to perform this obligation for 8+ months.

ICI'S RESPONSE:
Investment Concepts Inc. has stated the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season." They had April through October 2025 to make repairs. They chose not to.

ICI's conduct raises questions about their fitness to hold a California real estate license. They are collecting rent on properties they refuse to maintain — across four states.

DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports
- Photographs and video
- ICI's written rent concession letter (acknowledging defect)
- Security camera footage (re: false "declined" claim)
- Lease agreement
- Adjacent tenant testimony

THE PROBLEM:
I reported a roof leak on April 8, 2025—BEFORE I even had the keys to my space. ICI acknowledged the problem but handed me the keys anyway with the leak unrepaired.

- Current situation: 4 active leaks during peak retail season
- Duration: 8+ months with zero permanent repairs
- My business: Trading cards - cardboard products water destroys

4. Pattern of behavior: Adjacent tenant confirms 2+ years of same problem

ALLEGED CODE VIOLATIONS:

ARTICLE 1 - COMPETENCE
ICI has demonstrated incompetence in basic property maintenance by allowing chronic roof leaks to persist for over 8 months despite documented reports beginning BEFORE tenant possession. Adjacent tenant has experienced same problem for 2+ years.

ARTICLE 5 - TRUTHFULNESS
On August 8, 2025, ICI Property Manager Hubert Kim stated in writing that I "declined" leak diverters. This statement was false. I have security camera footage proving no such offer was declined.

ARTICLE 10 - COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS
ICI appears to be violating Oregon landlord-tenant law and our lease agreement (Section 8a) requiring landlord to maintain roof.

FACTS:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (before tenant had keys)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration unresolved: 8+ months
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ years
- ICI's response: "Wait until spring"

I am now connecting with tenants across ICI's portfolio in all four states. Early responses suggest this may be a pattern of conduct, not an isolated incident.

## 8. KGW 8 (NBC) - INVESTIGATIVE TEAM

**To:** newstips@kgw.com
**Subject:** Investigative Tip: Small Business vs. Corporate Landlord — Pattern of Neglect Across 4 States

```
Dear KGW Investigates Team,

I'm reaching out about a story that started with one leaky roof but may be much bigger.

THE QUICK VERSION:
- We're ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles in Oregon City
- We reported our first roof leak on April 8, 2025 - BEFORE we took possession
- The landlord acknowledged it. They handed us the keys anyway.
- 8 months later: 4 active leaks. We were told to "wait until spring."
- Our neighbor (same roof) has had this problem for 2+ YEARS

THE BIGGER STORY:
Our landlord — Investment Concepts Inc. — isn't just managing our building. They manage:
- 29 shopping centers
- 63 apartment buildings
- 1.8 million square feet
- Properties across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona

I've started connecting with other ICI tenants. The pattern is emerging: maintenance ignored, tenants dismissed, rent collected anyway.

THE KICKER:
- Their contractor suggested our leak was "just an old stain." Two more leaks appeared the next morning.
- The property manager claimed IN WRITING that we "declined" leak diverters. That was false.
- They had April through October to fix the roof. They didn't. Now they say "wait until spring."

WHAT WE HAVE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports and dismissals
- Photographs and video of every incident
- Security camera footage disproving management's false claims
- The landlord's written rent concession letter
- Neighbor testimony confirming 2+ years of the same issue
- We've filed complaints with Oregon DOJ, California DRE, BBB, and IREM

This started as David vs. Goliath. It may be turning into a story about corporate neglect across four states.

Available for interview, store tour, and full document review.

Dear Mr. Suraci,

I have a story about an Orange County-based company that may interest your investigative team.

Investment Concepts Inc. (1667 E. Lincoln Ave, Orange, CA 92865) manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona — 1.8 million square feet of property.

I am a commercial tenant at one of their Oregon properties, and I have extensively documented what appears to be a pattern of systematic tenant neglect.

MY CASE:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 — BEFORE I even had keys to the space
- Current status: 4 active leaks, 8+ months unresolved
- Landlord's response: "Wait until spring"
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ YEARS
- Property manager made false written claims about repairs I allegedly "declined"

THE BIGGER PICTURE:
I am now reaching out to ICI tenants across their portfolio. Early responses suggest this is not isolated. Online reviews of ICI properties show similar complaints — maintenance ignored, tenants dismissed, problems left to fester.

This is a company headquartered in your backyard that may be systematically neglecting tenants across four states while collecting rent on properties they refuse to maintain.

WHAT I HAVE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports and dismissals
- Photographs and video of every incident
- The landlord's written rent concession letter acknowledging the problem
- Testimony from adjacent tenant confirming years of the same issue
- Security footage disproving management's false claims

I have a story tip about an Orange County-based property management company that may be systematically neglecting tenants across four states.

THE COMPANY:
Investment Concepts Inc.
1667 E. Lincoln Ave, Orange, CA 92865
29 shopping centers, 63 apartment buildings

My neighbor — same roof, same landlord — has had this problem for over TWO YEARS.

I am now connecting with ICI tenants across their portfolio. The pattern is emerging: maintenance ignored, tenants dismissed, problems left to fester while rent is collected.

THE ANGLE:
An Orange County company managing nearly 2 million square feet of property across four states — and tenants say they can't get basic maintenance done.

Mayor McGriff,

I'm Mike Alarcon, co-owner of ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles at Oregon Center in Oregon City. I'm writing because an out-of-state corporation is neglecting property and small businesses in your city.

THE SITUATION:
We reported a roof leak before we even had the keys to our space—April 8, 2025. The landlord, Investment Concepts Inc. from Orange County, California, acknowledged it but handed us the keys with the leak unrepaired.

8 months later, we have 4 active leaks during our peak retail season. When we asked for repairs, we were told: "The roof cannot be repaired until after the rainy season."

ABOUT THE LANDLORD:
ICI isn't just managing our building. They manage 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across CA, NV, OR, and AZ — 1.8 million square feet. Our neighbor has had the same problem for 2+ years. This appears to be how they operate.

I've filed complaints with Oregon DOJ, California DRE, and local code enforcement. I wanted you to know this is happening in your city.

We're not asking for anything extraordinary — just a roof that doesn't leak.

THE SITUATION:
I'm a small business owner who reported a roof leak before I even had keys to my space—April 8, 2025. The landlord, Investment Concepts Inc. from Orange County, California, knew about it and rented me the space anyway.

8+ months later: 4 active leaks. Their response: "Wait until spring."

THE PATTERN:
My neighbor has had the same roof leak problem for OVER 2 YEARS. ICI manages 29 shopping centers and 63 apartment buildings across CA, NV, OR, AZ. This appears to be systemic corporate neglect, not one bad incident.

1/ We reported a roof leak before we even had the keys.

That was April 8, 2025.

It's now December. We have four active leaks.

But here's what we just learned: this is not just about us.

2/ Our landlord is Investment Concepts Inc. — based in Orange County, California.

They manage:
• 29 shopping centers
• 63 apartment buildings
• 1.8 MILLION square feet
• Properties in CA, NV, OR, AZ

---

3/ Our neighbor — same roof — has had leaks for over 2 YEARS.

Same landlord. Same neglect. Same excuses.

And when we started talking to other ICI tenants across their portfolio?

Same stories.

4/ This isn't one leaky roof in Oregon.

This appears to be how Investment Concepts Inc. operates across FOUR STATES.

Collect rent. Ignore maintenance. Blame tenants. Repeat.

5/ We have:
• 100+ emails documenting 8 months of neglect

I need to share something that has grown bigger than I expected.

I'm part of a small team running a trading card shop in Oregon City. We sell Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, sports cards — cardboard products that water destroys instantly.

We reported our first roof leak on April 8, 2025.

BEFORE WE EVEN HAD THE KEYS.

The landlord acknowledged it. The roofer was dispatched. It wasn't fixed. They handed us the keys anyway.

Eight months later, we have four active leaks during our peak retail season.

But here's what changed everything:

Our landlord — Investment Concepts Inc., based in Orange County, California — doesn't just manage our building. They manage 29 SHOPPING CENTERS and 63 APARTMENT BUILDINGS across California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona. That's 1.8 million square feet of property.

When we started reaching out to other ICI tenants, we started hearing the same stories:
→ Maintenance requests ignored
→ Problems blamed on tenants
→ Repairs delayed indefinitely
→ Rent collected anyway

This isn't just one leaky roof in Oregon. This appears to be a pattern of corporate neglect across four states.

So we built something. A place for ICI tenants to share their stories. To document the pattern. To make it impossible to ignore.

If you're an ICI tenant — commercial or residential — in California, Nevada, Oregon, or Arizona, we want to hear from you.

Together, we're impossible to ignore.

This is no longer just about your roof. This is about exposing a pattern of corporate neglect across 4 states and 92 properties.

Go make some noise.
