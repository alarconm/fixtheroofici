**Complaint Description (copy this):**

```
I am a commercial tenant at Oregon Center, Oregon City, OR. My landlord is Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI), a property management company based at 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865.

COMPLAINT SUMMARY:
Since April 8, 2025—before I even took possession of the space—I have reported chronic roof leaks that remain unresolved after 8+ months. The landlord has engaged in a pattern of unfair and deceptive business practices including:

1. FAILURE TO DISCLOSE KNOWN DEFECT: ICI rented me a commercial space knowing the roof leaked. The first leak was reported April 8, 2025, BEFORE I had keys. They acknowledged it, dispatched a roofer, failed to fix it, and handed me the keys anyway.

2. FALSE STATEMENTS: On August 8, 2025, ICI Property Manager Hubert Kim stated in writing that I "declined" leak diverters. This was demonstrably false. I have security camera footage proving no such offer was declined.

3. PATTERN OF NEGLECT: My adjacent tenant (a Thai restaurant sharing the same roof) confirms they have had the SAME roof leak problem for over 2 YEARS. This is not an isolated incident but a pattern of collecting rent on properties ICI refuses to maintain.

4. UNREASONABLE DELAYS: ICI had April through October 2025 (the dry season) to repair the roof. They did not. Now they claim the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season," leaving me with 4 active leaks during my peak retail season.

KEY FACTS:
- First leak reported: April 8, 2025 (BEFORE I had keys to the space)
- Current status: 4 active leaks
- Duration unresolved: 252+ days
- Adjacent tenant: Same problem for 2+ YEARS
- My business: Trading cards (cardboard products that water destroys)
- ICI's response: "Wait until spring"

ICI is a $9M/year property management company that claims IREM (Institute of Real Estate Management) accreditation. Their conduct raises serious concerns about their business practices and fitness to manage commercial properties.

I have extensive documentation available:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports and dismissals
- Photographs of every leak incident
- Video of active water intrusion
- Security camera footage
- ICI's written rent concession letter (acknowledging the problem)
- Lease agreement showing roof maintenance is landlord's responsibility (Section 8a)
- Testimony from adjacent tenant confirming 2+ year pattern

DESIRED RESOLUTION:
1. Investigation of ICI's business practices in Oregon
2. Permanent repair of the roof as required by our lease
3. Rent abatement for the period affected per lease terms

DOCUMENTATION: Available upon request. Full timeline at https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

PROPERTY INFORMATION:
Property Name: Oregon Center (shopping plaza)
Property Address: Oregon City, OR 97045
Property Owner: Oregon Ctr. LLC, managed by Investment Concepts Inc.
Owner Address: 1667 E. Lincoln Ave., Orange, CA 92865
Owner Phone: (714) 283-5800

COMPLAINANT:
Name: Mike Alarcon
Business: ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles
Address: Oregon Center, Suite 127, Oregon City, OR 97045
Phone: 503-389-5404
Email: mike@orbsportscards.com

COMPLAINT:
I am reporting ongoing building code violations related to roof integrity and water intrusion at Oregon Center shopping plaza in Oregon City.

NATURE OF VIOLATION:
Multiple chronic roof leaks affecting at least 2 commercial tenant spaces with no permanent repair for extended periods (8+ months for my space, 2+ years for adjacent tenant). This represents a failure to maintain the building envelope per Oregon building codes.

SPECIFIC ISSUES:
1. Active water intrusion through the roof during rain events
2. 4 separate leak locations currently active in my suite alone
3. Water damage to interior ceiling tiles and potential structural elements
4. Adjacent tenant (Thai restaurant) reports same roof leak issues for over 2 years
5. Property owner (out-of-state) refuses to make permanent repairs, stating roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season"

TIMELINE:
- April 8, 2025: First leak reported (before tenant took possession)
- April-December 2025: Multiple repair attempts, all failed
- December 2025: 4 active leaks, owner states no repairs until spring

SAFETY CONCERNS:
- Ongoing water intrusion may be causing hidden structural damage
- Potential mold growth from repeated water exposure
- Water near electrical fixtures in drop ceiling
- Unsafe conditions for tenants and customers

PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSE:
Investment Concepts Inc. (Orange County, CA) has stated the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season" despite having the entire dry season (April-October) to address the issue. This appears to be willful neglect of basic building maintenance.

DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE:
- 100+ emails documenting reports and failed repairs
- Photographs of all leak incidents
- Video of active water intrusion
- Landlord's written acknowledgment of the problem
- Adjacent tenant testimony confirming 2+ year pattern

I request inspection of this property and appropriate enforcement action.

PROPERTY COMPLAINT

Property: Oregon Center (shopping plaza), Oregon City, OR 97045
Property Owner: Oregon Ctr. LLC / Investment Concepts Inc. (Orange County, CA)
Issue: Building maintenance failure - chronic unrepaired roof leaks

I am a commercial tenant at Oregon Center reporting ongoing building maintenance failures that the out-of-state property owner has refused to address for over 8 months.

SITUATION:
- Multiple active roof leaks in my commercial space (Suite 127)
- First leak reported April 8, 2025 - BEFORE I took possession
- Currently 4 active leak locations
- Adjacent tenant confirms same problem for 2+ YEARS
- Property owner (Investment Concepts Inc., based in Orange County, CA) refuses permanent repairs

OWNER'S RESPONSE:
"The roof cannot be repaired until after the rainy season."

They had April through October to fix this. They chose not to. Now tenants suffer.

This property is being neglected by an absentee corporate landlord 1,400 miles away in California. They collect rent but refuse to maintain the building.

I request inspection of Oregon Center and appropriate enforcement action against the property owner.

COMPLAINT AGAINST LICENSED REAL ESTATE BROKER/PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY

RESPONDENT INFORMATION:
Company Name: Investment Concepts Inc.

Address: Oregon Center, Suite 127, Oregon City, OR 97045
Phone: 503-389-5404
Email: mike@orbsportscards.com

NATURE OF COMPLAINT:
I am filing a complaint against Investment Concepts Inc., a California-licensed real estate and property management company, regarding their management of commercial property in Oregon City, Oregon.

SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS:

1. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPERTY (Breach of Fiduciary Duty)
ICI manages Oregon Center shopping plaza in Oregon City, OR. As a commercial tenant, I reported a roof leak on April 8, 2025—BEFORE I even took possession of the space. ICI acknowledged the problem, dispatched a roofer, but failed to repair it before handing me the keys. 8+ months later, I have 4 active leaks and have been told to "wait until spring."

2. MISREPRESENTATION / FALSE STATEMENTS
On August 8, 2025, ICI Property Manager Hubert Kim stated in writing that I "declined" leak diverters offered to mitigate the problem. This statement was false. I have security camera footage with audio proving no such offer was declined. Making false written statements to tenants raises serious concerns about ICI's business practices.

3. PATTERN OF NEGLECT ACROSS PROPERTY
My adjacent tenant (a Thai restaurant sharing the same roof) confirms they have experienced the SAME roof leak problem for over 2 YEARS with the same lack of permanent repair. This establishes a pattern of ICI collecting rent on properties they refuse to properly maintain.

4. FAILURE TO PERFORM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Per our lease agreement (Section 8a), roof maintenance is explicitly the landlord's responsibility. ICI has failed to perform this obligation for 8+ months despite:
- Repeated written reports
- Photo and video documentation
- Written acknowledgment of the problem (rent concession letter)

TIMELINE OF EVENTS:
- April 8, 2025: First leak reported (before I had keys)
- April 10-11, 2025: Second leak, marked "urgent" by property manager
- May 1, 2025: I took possession with known, unrepaired leak
- May 16-17, 2025: Multiple new leaks; contractor questioned if I knew what a leak was
- June-August 2025: Repeated reports, temporary patches only
- August 8, 2025: Property manager made false written claim about "declined" diverters
- September 2025: ICI issued rent concession letter acknowledging problem
- October 2025: Brief respite, then leaks returned within 4 days
- December 2025: 4 active leaks; told to "wait until spring"

IMPACT:
My business sells trading cards (Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, sports cards)—cardboard products that water destroys instantly. I am paying rent for a commercial space I cannot fully use during my peak retail season because the roof leaks.

ICI'S RESPONSE:
Investment Concepts Inc. has stated the roof "cannot be repaired until after the rainy season." They had April through October 2025 to make repairs. They chose not to.

ADDITIONAL CONCERNS:
- ICI claims IREM (Institute of Real Estate Management) AMO accreditation on their website
- ICI operates properties in multiple states (CA, OR, NV, AZ) - this may not be isolated
- ICI is a $9M/year company with resources to maintain their properties

DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports
- Photographs of all leak incidents
- Video of active water intrusion
- ICI's written rent concession letter (acknowledging defect)
- Security camera footage (re: false "declined" claim)
- Lease agreement showing landlord responsibility
- Adjacent tenant testimony (2+ years same problem)

REQUESTED ACTION:
1. Investigation of ICI's property management practices
2. Determination of whether ICI's conduct violates California real estate law
3. Appropriate disciplinary action

COMPLAINT AGAINST: Investment Concepts Inc.

I am a commercial tenant at an Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI) property: Oregon Center in Oregon City, Oregon.

THE PROBLEM:
I reported a roof leak on April 8, 2025—BEFORE I even had the keys to my space. ICI acknowledged the problem but handed me the keys anyway with the leak unrepaired.

8+ months later, I have 4 active roof leaks. ICI has told me to "wait until spring" for repairs.

KEY FACTS:
- First leak: Reported April 8, 2025 (before I took possession)
- Current situation: 4 active leaks during peak retail season
- Duration: 8+ months with zero permanent repairs
- My business: Trading cards - cardboard products water destroys
- Adjacent tenant: Same roof leak problem for 2+ YEARS (same landlord, same neglect)

ISSUES WITH ICI'S CONDUCT:

1. Rented me a space with a known defect they failed to fix

2. Property manager made a false written statement claiming I "declined" leak diverters (I have security footage proving otherwise)

3. Had April-October (dry season) to repair the roof but didn't

4. Now claims repairs are impossible until spring while I pay rent for space I can't fully use

5. Pattern of behavior: Adjacent tenant confirms 2+ years of same problem

MY LEASE SAYS:
Section 8(a): Landlord is responsible for "repair and maintenance of exterior walls, roof, gutters, downspouts, foundation."

ICI is breaching this obligation and has been for 8+ months.

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
- 100+ emails to property management and contractors
- Photographs and video of every incident
- Repeated requests for repair timeline
- Offer to accommodate repair crews anytime

ICI'S RESPONSE:
"The roof cannot be repaired until after the rainy season."

WHAT I WANT:
1. Written repair timeline with specific dates
2. Completion of permanent roof repair
3. Rent abatement for the months this space has been unusable

DOCUMENTATION:
Full timeline with all evidence at https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

This is not a one-time issue. It's a pattern of a property management company collecting rent on properties they refuse to maintain. My neighbor has dealt with this for 2+ years. ICI knows about this problem and doesn't care.

INTRODUCTION:
I am filing a formal ethics complaint against Investment Concepts Inc. (ICI), which represents itself as an IREM Accredited Management Organization on its website. ICI's conduct in managing Oregon Center in Oregon City, Oregon, appears to violate multiple articles of the IREM Code of Professional Ethics.

ALLEGED CODE VIOLATIONS:

ARTICLE 1 - COMPETENCE
"A MEMBER shall not undertake or continue to perform management activities unless the member is competent to do so."

ICI has demonstrated incompetence in basic property maintenance by allowing chronic roof leaks to persist for over 8 months at Oregon Center despite:
- Documented reports beginning April 8, 2025 (before tenant possession)
- Multiple failed repair attempts
- Clear lease obligations requiring roof maintenance
- Adjacent tenant experiencing same problem for 2+ years

A competent property manager would have resolved a known roof leak before renting the space, or at minimum within 8 months of continuous reports.

ARTICLE 3 - FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS
"A MEMBER shall protect the property of all parties whom the member has been engaged to serve against all reasonably foreseeable contingencies."

ICI has failed to protect the property itself. Ongoing water intrusion for 8+ months (and 2+ years for adjacent tenant) likely causes:
- Structural damage to roof and ceiling systems
- Potential mold growth
- Deterioration of building systems
- Decreased property value

ICI's refusal to repair until "after the rainy season" demonstrates prioritization of cost avoidance over property protection.

ARTICLE 5 - RELATIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS AND THE PROFESSION
"A MEMBER shall not make any false, misleading or deceptive statement in any matter relating to the conduct of professional activities."

On August 8, 2025, ICI Property Manager Hubert Kim stated in writing that I "declined" leak diverters offered to mitigate the problem. This statement was false. I have security camera footage with audio proving no such offer was declined. Making false written statements to tenants is deceptive and reflects poorly on the profession.

ARTICLE 10 - COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS
"A MEMBER shall use due diligence to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

ICI appears to be violating:
- Oregon landlord-tenant law requiring maintenance of premises
- Our lease agreement (Section 8a) requiring landlord to maintain roof
- Potentially Oregon building codes regarding building envelope integrity

FACTUAL BASIS:

Timeline of Events:
- April 8, 2025: First leak reported (BEFORE I had keys)
- April 10-11, 2025: Second leak, property manager called it "urgent"
- May 2025: Took possession with unrepaired leak; multiple new leaks appeared
- May 16, 2025: Contractor suggested leak was "old stain" - two more leaks next day
- June-August 2025: Repeated reports, only temporary patches
- August 8, 2025: Property manager's false written statement about "declined" repairs
- September 2025: ICI issued rent concession letter acknowledging problem
- October 2025: Leaks returned within 4 days of "repairs"
- December 2025: Currently 4 active leaks; told to "wait until spring"

Pattern of Neglect:
Adjacent tenant (Thai restaurant, same roof) confirms they have experienced identical roof leak problems for OVER 2 YEARS with no permanent repair. This establishes that ICI's failure to maintain Oregon Center is not an isolated incident but a pattern of behavior.

ICI's Response:
"The roof cannot be repaired until after the rainy season."
They had April-October 2025 (entire dry season) to repair. They did not.

Impact on Tenants:
My business sells trading cards—cardboard products instantly destroyed by water. I am paying rent for a space I cannot fully use during peak retail season because ICI will not maintain the roof.

DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports
- Photographs of all leak incidents
- Video of active water intrusion
- ICI's written rent concession letter
- Security camera footage (re: false claim)
- Lease agreement
- Adjacent tenant testimony

If Investment Concepts Inc. is an IREM AMO member, their conduct reflects poorly on IREM's accreditation standards and violates the Code of Professional Ethics that members are required to uphold.

REQUESTED ACTION:
1. Investigation of this complaint
2. Determination of whether ICI has violated the IREM Code of Professional Ethics
3. Appropriate disciplinary action if violations are found

Full documentation: https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

I am available to provide any additional information or documentation needed for this investigation.

## 8. KGW 8 (NBC) - INVESTIGATIVE TEAM

**To:** newstips@kgw.com
**Subject:** Investigative Tip: Oregon City Small Business vs. Corporate Slumlord - 8 Months of Documented Neglect

```
Dear KGW Investigates Team,

I'm reaching out about a story with extensive documentation: a small business owner who reported a roof leak BEFORE he even had the keys, and 8 months later has 4 active leaks while his corporate landlord tells him to "wait until spring."

THE QUICK VERSION:
We're ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles in Oregon City—a small team running a trading card shop. We sell Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, sports cards—cardboard that water destroys instantly.

We reported our first leak on April 8, 2025—during buildout, BEFORE we took possession.

The landlord acknowledged it. The roofer came. It wasn't fixed. They handed us the keys anyway.

8 months later: 4 active leaks during our peak holiday retail season.

THE LANDLORD:
Investment Concepts Inc.—a $9M/year property management company based in Orange County, California, 1,400 miles away. They claim IREM accreditation on their website.

THE PATTERN:
We just learned our neighbor—a Thai restaurant sharing the same roof—has dealt with this for OVER 2 YEARS. Same landlord. Same neglect. Same excuses. This isn't a one-time issue. It's how they operate.

THE GASLIGHTING:
- Their contractor suggested our leak was "just an old stain." Two more leaks appeared the next morning. Those tiles were brand new.
- When we pushed back, we were told: "It helps if you answer the questions." We had answered every question.
- The property manager claimed IN WRITING that we "declined" leak diverters. That was false—we have security footage.
- They had April through October to fix the roof. They didn't. Now they say "wait until spring."

WHAT WE HAVE:
- 100+ emails documenting 8 months of reports and dismissals
- Photographs of every incident
- Video of active leaks
- Security camera footage (proving the false "declined" claim)
- The landlord's written rent concession letter (acknowledging the problem)
- Neighbor testimony confirming 2+ years of the same issue
- We've filed complaints with Oregon DOJ, California DRE, BBB, IREM, and local code enforcement

THE HUMAN ANGLE:
Three people trying to build a small business—hosting weekly Magic: The Gathering tournaments, building community, teaching kids to play Pokémon—watching their dream threatened because a corporate landlord 1,400 miles away won't maintain their building.

This is a David vs. Goliath story with a paper trail a mile long.

WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR:
A roof that doesn't leak. That's it.

Available for interview, store tour, and full document review at your convenience.

## 14. PORTLAND BUSINESS JOURNAL

**To:** portland@bizjournals.com
**Subject:** Story: Out-of-State Commercial Landlord Neglecting Oregon Small Businesses

```
Dear Portland Business Journal,

I have a story that raises questions about how out-of-state commercial landlords treat Oregon businesses.

THE SITUATION:
ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles, a small retail business in Oregon City, has documented 8+ months of unresolved roof leaks at their commercial space. The landlord—Investment Concepts Inc., a $9M/year property management company based in Orange County, California—has told them to "wait until spring" for repairs despite having the entire dry season to fix the issue.

THE BUSINESS ANGLE:
- Small Oregon retailer vs. California corporate landlord
- Pattern extends beyond one tenant: adjacent business has same problem for 2+ years
- Raises questions about absentee ownership and property maintenance standards
- ICI claims IREM accreditation but appears to violate basic property management standards

KEY FACTS:
- First leak reported April 8, 2025 (before tenant took possession)
- Landlord knew, handed over keys anyway
- 8 months, 4 active leaks, zero permanent repairs
- Tenant sells trading cards (cardboard)—water destroys inventory
- ICI manages properties in CA, OR, NV, AZ—is this pattern widespread?

This could be a broader story about commercial real estate practices and what happens when out-of-state corporations own Oregon properties without maintaining them.

## 16. OREGON CITY MAYOR DENYSE McGRIFF

**To:** dmcgriff@orcity.org
**Subject:** Oregon City Small Business Needs Your Help - Out-of-State Landlord Neglect

```
Mayor McGriff,

I'm Mike Alarcon, co-owner of ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles at Oregon Center in Oregon City. I'm writing because an out-of-state corporation is neglecting property and small businesses in your city.

THE SITUATION:
We reported a roof leak before we even had the keys to our space—April 8, 2025. The landlord, Investment Concepts Inc. from Orange County, California, acknowledged it but handed us the keys with the leak unrepaired.

8 months later, we have 4 active leaks during our peak retail season. When we asked for repairs, we were told: "The roof cannot be repaired until after the rainy season."

They had April through October to fix it. They chose not to.

THE PATTERN:
Our neighbor—a Thai restaurant sharing the same roof—has had the same problem for over 2 years. Same landlord. Same neglect. This isn't a one-time issue. It's how this out-of-state company treats Oregon City businesses.

WHY I'M WRITING TO YOU:
I believe you care about small businesses in Oregon City. A California corporation is collecting rent on properties here while refusing to maintain them. They're 1,400 miles away. They don't care about our community. They just want our rent checks.

I've filed complaints with Oregon DOJ, Oregon Building Codes Division, California DRE, and local code enforcement. I wanted you to know this is happening in your city.

WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR:
Just a roof that doesn't leak. That's it.

Full documentation: https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you or your office. Oregon City deserves better than absentee landlords who neglect our community.

Respectfully,

## 17. CLACKAMAS COUNTY COMMISSIONERS

**To:** bcc@clackamas.us
**Subject:** Out-of-State Landlord Neglecting Oregon City Commercial Property

```
Clackamas County Commissioners,

I'm writing to alert you to a pattern of property neglect at Oregon Center in Oregon City by an out-of-state property management company.

THE SITUATION:
I'm a small business owner (ORB Trading Cards & Collectibles) who reported a roof leak before I even had keys to my space—April 8, 2025. The landlord, Investment Concepts Inc. from Orange County, California, knew about it and rented me the space anyway.

8+ months later: 4 active leaks. Their response: "Wait until spring."

THE PATTERN:
My neighbor has had the same roof leak problem for OVER 2 YEARS. Same landlord. Same neglect. This isn't one bad incident—it's how this company operates.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CLACKAMAS COUNTY:
- Out-of-state corporations owning properties here without maintaining them
- Small businesses paying rent for spaces they can't fully use
- Building deterioration from years of water intrusion
- Oregon businesses subsidizing California company profits

I've filed complaints with multiple agencies. I wanted the County Commissioners to be aware that this is happening in Clackamas County.

Full documentation: https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

- My neighbor: Same problem for 2+ YEARS

WHAT I'VE DONE:
I have filed formal complaints with:
- Oregon DOJ Consumer Protection
- Oregon Building Codes Division
- Oregon City Code Enforcement
- Clackamas County Code Enforcement
- California Department of Real Estate
- Better Business Bureau
- IREM Ethics Committee

I have contacted:
- Every major Portland TV station (KGW, KOIN, KATU, FOX 12)
- The Oregonian, Willamette Week, Portland Business Journal
- Oregon City Mayor
- Clackamas County Commissioners

DOCUMENTATION:
All evidence—100+ emails, photographs, video, your rent concession letter, security footage—is publicly available at:
https://fixtheroofici.replit.app

WHAT I WANT:
A roof that doesn't leak. That's it.

You've had 8+ months. My neighbor has waited 2+ years. How long do Oregon tenants have to wait for basic maintenance from a $9M/year property management company?

The world is watching now.
