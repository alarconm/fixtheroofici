## Summary

Jenny Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant nail salon owner, has been a tenant for years paying rent on time. She wrote a heartfelt letter to ICI explaining economic hardship and requesting rent relief. ICI's response completely ignored her request and instead proposed rent INCREASES of 3-6% annually while her roof is actively leaking.

This demonstrates ICI's pattern of exploiting vulnerable tenants, particularly immigrants who may face language barriers and have fewer resources to fight back.

## Original Email from Jenny to ICI

Hi William, how are you today?

After 25 years of working as a nail artist, I have never felt as difficult as it is now. In 2025, everything seems to be turned upside down. Last month, the US government shut down. Television always talks about political instability and economic weakness. Gasoline prices increase, food prices increase, rents also increase. Inflation keeps climbing forever. There are only 2-3 guests a day. There was a day when there was no one. Sitting looking at the empty nail chair, I wonder if I can hold on? The regular customer called to cancel the appointment: "I'm sorry honey, I have to cut back on expenses this month." (I'm sorry, I have to cut my spending this month.) It's not that they don't want to be beautiful. They simply have no extra money to do nails anymore.

I Also try very hard....Reduce the price. Run ads on Facebook. Make a promotion 15%discount. But no one came. Because when people have to choose between filling up the gas to go to work or beautifying their nails, the answer is too A whole Vietnamese community of nail artists is in worry.

I don't blame anyone...
Don't blame the government. Don't blame customers. This is a difficult time together. Everyone is trying to survive. But at night, looking at the pile of electricity bills, water bills, unpaid rent, doing business is difficult but the cost is not reduced, I also can't sleep I still have hope...

It still opens on time every morning. Still clean the shop thoroughly. Still prepare full paint colors, tools, waiting for guests to come. Because I believe that all difficulties will pass. America has experienced many crises, and then overcame them.

And when the economy recovers, people like us - those who are persistent, hardworking, keep the profession - will be the ones who stand firm.

For nearly five years, I have paid the rent on time, last few months been difficult but I still paid Every month. I beg and ask the owner of this building to help me get through this difficult period, can they help me a rent reduction or give me a few months to help me get through and I still want to continue signing the contract for another three years.

Thank you,
Topnail
Jenny Nguyen

## Key Issues

1. **Complete disregard for tenant's request** - Jenny explicitly asked for rent reduction or relief. William's response does not acknowledge this at all.

2. **Rent increase during hardship** - Instead of relief, ICI proposed 3-6% annual increases.

3. **Active roof leaks** - Jenny's unit has active roof leaks (confirmed December 18, 2025) while ICI demands more rent.

4. **Exploitation of vulnerable tenant** - Jenny is a Vietnamese immigrant small business owner who may face language barriers. ICI appears to be taking advantage of this.

5. **Security deposit demand** - ICI is demanding a security deposit from a tenant who has paid reliably for nearly 5 years.

## Drafted Response for Jenny

**Subject: RE: Topnails in Oregon City, Oregon - Lease Renewal and Outstanding Maintenance Issues**

Dear Mr. Shiney,

Thank you for your response. However, I must address several concerns before any lease renewal discussion can proceed.

**1. My Request Was Ignored**

In my previous email, I explained the severe economic hardship my business is facing and respectfully requested a rent reduction or temporary relief. Your response did not acknowledge this request at all. Instead, you proposed rent increases of 3-6% annually. This is not acceptable given current circumstances.

**2. Outstanding Maintenance Issues**

The roof above my unit has been leaking, causing damage to my business and creating unsafe conditions for my customers and staff. Under Oregon law (ORS 90.730) and standard commercial lease terms, the landlord is obligated to maintain the structural integrity of the building, including the roof.

I cannot agree to pay increased rent for a space that Investment Concepts, Inc. has failed to properly maintain. Before I consider any renewal, I require:
- Immediate repair of all roof leaks affecting my unit
- Written confirmation of when repairs will be completed
- Documentation that the repairs have been made

**3. Revised Proposal Request**

Given that:
- I have been a reliable tenant for years, paying rent on time
- The building has unresolved maintenance issues
- The current economic climate has severely impacted small businesses

I am requesting a lease renewal at my current rate or reduced rent—not an increase. I am willing to discuss a 3-year term once the maintenance issues are resolved and a fair rent is proposed.

Please respond to the specific concerns I have raised.

Sincerely,
Jenny Nguyen
Top Nails
Oregon City, Oregon
